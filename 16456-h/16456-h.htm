<h3 class="chap">LIMBERHAM.</h3>

<p>The extreme indelicacy of this play would, in the present times
furnish ample and most just grounds for the unfavourable reception
it met with from the public. But in the reign of Charles II. many
plays were applauded, in which the painting is, at least, as coarse as
that of Dryden. "Bellamira, or the Mistress," a gross translation by
Sir Charles Sedley of Terence's "Eunuchus," had been often represented
with the highest approbation. But the satire of Dryden was
rather accounted too personal, than too loose. The character of Limberham
has been supposed to represent Lauderdale, whose age
and uncouth figure rendered ridiculous his ungainly affectation of
fashionable vices. Mr Malone intimates a suspicion, that Shaftesbury
was the person levelled at, whose lameness and infirmities made the
satire equally poignant. In either supposition, a powerful and
leading nobleman was offended, to whose party all seem to have
drawn, whose loose conduct, in that loose age, exposed them to be
duped like the hero of the play. It is a singular mark of the
dissolute manners of those times, that an audience, to whom matrimonial
infidelity was nightly held out, not only as the most venial
of trespasses, but as a matter of triumphant applause, were
unable to brook any ridicule, upon the mere transitory connection
formed betwixt the keeper and his mistress. Dryden had spared
neither kind of union; and accordingly his opponents exclaimed,
"That he lampooned the court, to oblige his friends in the city, and
ridiculed the city, to secure a promising lord at court; exposed
the kind keepers of Covent Garden, to please the cuckolds of
Cheapside; and drolled on the city Do-littles, to tickle the Covent-Garden
Limberhams<a class="ftnt" href="#Limbe_1-1">[1]</a>." Even Langbaine, relentless as he is in criticism,
seems to have considered the condemnation of Limberham
as the vengeance of the faction ridiculed.</p>

<p>"In this play, (which I take to be the best comedy of his) he
so much exposed the keeping part of the town, that the play was
stopt when it had but thrice appeared on the stage; but the
<span class="pgnm">004</span><a id="page_004" name="page_004"></a>
author took a becoming care, that the things that offended on
the stage, were either altered or omitted in the press. One of
our modern writers, in a short satire against keeping, concludes
thus:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>"Dryden, good man, thought keepers to reclaim,</p>
<p>Writ a kind satire, call'd it Limberham.</p>
<p>This all the herd of letchers straight alarms;</p>
<p>From Charing-Cross to Bow was up in arms:</p>
<p>They damn'd the play all at one fatal blow,</p>
<p>And broke the glass, that did their picture show."</p>
</div>

<p>Mr Malone mentions his having seen a MS. copy of this play,
found by Lord Bolingbroke among the sweepings of Pope's study,
in which there occur several indecent passages, not to be found
in the printed copy. These, doubtless, constituted the castrations,
which, in obedience to the public voice, our author expunged from
his play, after its condemnation. It is difficult to guess what could
be the nature of the indecencies struck out, when we consider those
which the poet deemed himself at liberty to retain.</p>

<p>The reader will probably easily excuse any remarks upon this
comedy. It is not absolutely without humour, but is so disgustingly
coarse, as entirely to destroy that merit. Langbaine, with his
usual anxiety of research, traces back a few of the incidents to the
novels of Cinthio Giraldi, and to those of some forgotten French
authors.</p>

<p>Plays, even of this nature, being worth preservation, as containing
genuine traces of the manners of the age in which they
appear, I cannot but remark the promiscuous intercourse, which,
in this comedy and others, is represented as taking place betwixt
women of character, and those who made no pretensions to it. Bellamira
in Sir Charles Sedley's play, and Mrs Tricksy in the following
pages, are admitted into company with the modest female
characters, without the least hint of exception or impropriety.
Such were actually the manners of Charles the II.d's time, where
we find the mistresses of the king, and his brothers, familiar
in the highest circles. It appears, from the evidence in the case
of the duchess of Norfolk for adultery, that Nell Gwyn was living
with her Grace in familiar habits; her society, doubtless, paving
the way for the intrigue, by which the unfortunate lady lost her
rank and reputation<a class="ftnt" href="#Limbe_1-2">[2]</a>. It is always symptomatic of a total decay
of morals, where female reputation neither confers dignity,
<span class="pgnm">005</span><a id="page_005" name="page_005"></a>
nor excites pride, in its possessor; but is consistent with her
mingling in the society of the libertine and the profligate.</p>

<p>Some of Dryden's libellers draw an invidious comparison betwixt
his own private life and this satire; and exhort him to</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>Be to vices, which he practised, kind.</p>
</div>

<p class="noind">But of the injustice of this charge on Dryden's character, we
have spoken fully elsewhere. Undoubtedly he had the licence
of this, and his other dramatic writings, in his mind, when he wrote
the following verses; where the impurity of the stage is traced to
its radical source, the debauchery of the court:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>Then courts of kings were held in high renown,</p>
<p>Ere made the common brothels of the town.</p>
<p>There virgins honourable vows received,</p>
<p>But chaste, as maids in monasteries, lived.</p>
<p>The king himself, to nuptial rites a slave,</p>
<p>No bad example to his poets gave;</p>
<p>And they, not bad, but in a vicious age,</p>
<p>Had not, to please the prince, debauched the stage.</p>
<p class="citation"><i>Wife of Bath's Tale.</i></p>
</div>

<p>"Limberham" was acted at the Duke's Theatre in Dorset-Garden;
for, being a satire upon a court vice, it was deemed peculiarly
calculated for that play-house. The concourse of the citizens thither
is alluded to in the prologue to "Marriage-a-la-Mode." Ravenscroft
also, in his epilogue to the "Citizen turned Gentleman,"
acted at the same theatre, disowns the patronage of the courtiers
who kept mistresses, probably because they Constituted the minor
part of his audience:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>From the court party we hope no success;</p>
<p>Our author is not one of the noblesse,</p>
<p>That bravely does maintain his miss in town,</p>
<p>Whilst my great lady is with speed sent down,</p>
<p>And forced in country mansion-house to fix.</p>
<p>That miss may rattle here in coach-and-six.</p>
</div>

<p>The stage for introducing "Limberham" was therefore judiciously
chosen, although the piece was ill received, and withdrawn after
being only thrice represented. It was printed in 1678.</p>

<h3 class="chap">TO
THE RIGHT HONOURABLE
JOHN,
LORD VAUGHAN, &amp;c<a class="ftnt" href="#Limbe_2-1">[1]</a>.</h3>

<p class="noind smcap">My Lord,</p>

<p>I cannot easily excuse the printing of a play at so
unseasonable a time<a class="ftnt" href="#Limbe_2-2">[2]</a>, when the great plot of the
nation, like one of Pharaoh's lean kine, has devoured
<span class="pgnm">007</span><a id="page_007" name="page_007"></a>
its younger brethren of the stage. But however
weak my defence might be for this, I am sure I
should not need any to the world for my dedication
to your lordship; and if you can pardon my presumption
in it, that a bad poet should address himself
to so great a judge of wit, I may hope at least
to escape with the excuse of Catullus, when he writ
to Cicero:</p>

<div class="poem pi">
<p>Gratias tibi maximas Catullus</p>
<p>Agit, pessimus omnium, poeta;</p>
<p>Tanto pessimus omnium poeta,</p>
<p>Quanto tu optimns omnium patronus.</p>
</div>

<p>I have seen an epistle of Flecknoe's to a nobleman,
who was by some extraordinary chance a scholar;
(and you may please to take notice by the way, how
natural the connection of thought is betwixt a bad
poet and Flecknoe) where he begins thus: <i>Quatuordecim
jam elapsi sunt anni,</i> &amp;c.; his Latin, it seems,
not holding out to the end of the sentence: but he
endeavoured to tell his patron, betwixt two languages
which he understood alike, that it was fourteen
years since he had the happiness to know him.
It is just so long, (and as happy be the omen of dulness
to me, as it is to some clergymen and statesmen!)
since your lordship has known, that there is a
worse poet remaining in the world, than he of scandalous
memory, who left it last<a class="ftnt" href="#Limbe_2-3">[3]</a>. I might enlarge
<span class="pgnm">008</span><a id="page_008" name="page_008"></a>
upon the subject with my author, and assure you,
that I have served as long for you, as one of the
patriarchs did for his Old-Testament mistress; but I
leave those flourishes, when occasion shall serve, for
a greater orator to use, and dare only tell you, that
I never passed any part of my life with greater
satisfaction or improvement to myself, than those
years which I have lived in the honour of your
lordship's acquaintance; if I may have only the
time abated when the public service called you to
another part of the world, which, in imitation of
our florid speakers, I might (if I durst presume upon
the expression) call the <i>parenthesis of my life</i>.</p>

<p>That I have always honoured you, I suppose I
need not tell you at this time of day; for you know
I staid not to date my respects to you from that
title which now you have, and to which you bring
a greater addition by your merit, than you receive
from it by the name; but I am proud to let others
know, how long it is that I have been made happy
by my knowledge of you; because I am sure it will
give me a reputation with the present age, and with
posterity. And now, my lord, I know you are
afraid, lest I should take this occasion, which lies
<span class="pgnm">009</span><a id="page_009" name="page_009"></a>
so fair for me, to acquaint the world with some of
those excellencies which I have admired in you;
but I have reasonably considered, that to acquaint
the world, is a phrase of a malicious meaning; for
it would imply, that the world were not already
acquainted with them. You are so generally known
to be above the meanness of my praises, that you
have spared my evidence, and spoiled my compliment:
Should I take for my common places, your
knowledge both of the old and the new philosophy;
should I add to these your skill in mathematics
and history; and yet farther, your being conversant
with all the ancient authors of the Greek and Latin
tongues, as well as with the modern&mdash;I should tell
nothing new to mankind; for when I have once
but named you, the world will anticipate all my
commendations, and go faster before me than I can
follow. Be therefore secure, my lord, that your own
fame has freed itself from the danger of a panegyric;
and only give me leave to tell you, that I value the
candour of your nature, and that one character of
friendliness, and, if I may have leave to call it, kindness
in you, before all those other which make you
considerable in the nation<a class="ftnt" href="#Limbe_2-4">[4]</a>.</p>

<p>Some few of our nobility are learned, and therefore
I will not conclude an absolute contradiction
in the terms of nobleman and scholar; but as the
<span class="pgnm">010</span><a id="page_010" name="page_010"></a>
world goes now, 'tis very hard to predicate one upon
the other; and 'tis yet more difficult to prove, that
a nobleman can be a friend to poetry. Were it not
for two or three instances in Whitehall, and in the
town, the poets of this age would find so little encouragement
for their labours, and so few understanders,
that they might have leisure to turn pamphleteers,
and augment the number of those abominable
scribblers, who, in this time of licence, abuse the
press, almost every day, with nonsense, and railing
against the government.</p>

<p>It remains, my lord, that I should give you some
account of this comedy, which you have never seen;
because it was written and acted in your absence,
at your government of Jamaica. It was intended
for an honest satire against our crying sin of <i>keeping</i>;
how it would have succeeded, I can but guess,
for it was permitted to be acted only thrice. The
crime, for which it suffered, was that which is objected
against the satires of Juvenal, and the epigrams
of Catullus, that it expressed too much of the vice
which it decried. Your lordship knows what answer
was returned by the elder of those poets, whom
I last mentioned, to his accusers:</p>

<div class="poem pi">
<p>&mdash;castum esse decet pium poetam</p>
<p>Ipsum. Versiculos nihil necesse est:</p>
<p>Qui tum denique habent salem ac leporem</p>
<p>Si sint molliculi et parum pudici.</p>
</div>

<p class="noind">But I dare not make that apology for myself; and
therefore have taken a becoming care, that those
things which offended on the stage, might be either
altered, or omitted in the press; for their authority
is, and shall be, ever sacred to me, as much absent
as present, and in all alterations of their fortune,
who for those reasons have stopped its farther appearance
on the theatre. And whatsoever hindrance
it has been to me in point of profit, many of my
<span class="pgnm">011</span><a id="page_011" name="page_011"></a>
friends can bear me witness, that I have not once
murmured against that decree. The same fortune
once happened to Moliere, on the occasion of his
"Tartuffe;" which, notwithstanding, afterwards has
seen the light, in a country more bigot than ours,
and is accounted amongst the best pieces of that
poet. I will be bold enough to say, that this comedy
is of the first rank of those which I have written,
and that posterity will be of my opinion. It
has nothing of particular satire in it; for whatsoever
may have been pretended by some critics in
the town, I may safely and solemnly affirm, that
no one character has been drawn from any single
man; and that I have known so many of the same
humour, in every folly which is here exposed, as
may serve to warrant it from a particular reflection.
It was printed in my absence from the town, this
summer, much against my expectation; otherwise
I had over-looked the press, and been yet more careful,
that neither my friends should have had the
least occasion of unkindness against me, nor my
enemies of upbraiding me; but if it live to a second
impression, I will faithfully perform what has been
wanting in this. In the mean time, my lord, I recommend
it to your protection, and beg I may keep
still that place in your favour which I have hitherto
enjoyed; and which I shall reckon as one of the
greatest blessings which can befall,</p>

<p>Footnotes:</p>

<li><a id="Limbe_2-1" name="Limbe_2-1"></a>John, Lord Vaughan, was the eldest surviving son of Richard,
Earl of Carbery, to which title he afterwards succeeded. He was
a man of literature, and president of the Royal Society from 1686
to 1689. Dryden was distinguished by his patronage as far back
as 1664, being fourteen years before the acting of this play. Lord
Vaughan had thus the honour of discovering and admiring the
poet's genius, before the public applause had fixed his fame; and,
probably better deserved the panegyric here bestowed, than was
Usual among Dryden's patrons. He wrote a recommendatory
copy of verses, which are prefixed to "The Conquest of Granada."
Mr Malone informs us, that this accomplished nobleman died at
Chelsea, on 16th January, 1712-13.</li>

<li><a id="Limbe_2-2" name="Limbe_2-2"></a>The great popish plot, that scene of mystery and blood, broke
out in August 1678.</li>

<li><a id="Limbe_2-3" name="Limbe_2-3"></a>Flecknoe was a Roman Catholic priest, very much addicted to
scribbling verses. His name has been chiefly preserved by our
author's satire of "Mack-Flecknoe;" in which he has depicted
Shadwell, as the literary son and heir of this wretched poetaster. A
few farther particulars concerning him may be found prefixed to
that poem. Flecknoe, from this dedication, appears to have been
just deceased. The particular passage referred to has not been
discovered; even Langbaine had never seen it: but Mr Malone points
out a letter of Flecknoe to the Cardinal Barberini, whereof the
first sentence is in Latin, and the next in English. Our author, in
an uncommon strain of self-depreciation, or rather to give a neat
turn to his sentence, has avouched himself to be a worse poet than
Flecknoe. But expressions of modesty in a dedication, like those
of panegyric, are not to be understood literally. As in the latter,
Dryden often strains a note beyond <i>Ela</i>, so, on the present occasion,
he has certainly sounded the very base string of humility. Poor
Flecknoe, indeed, seems to have become proverbial, as the worst
of poets. The Earl of Dorset thus begins a satire on Edward
Howard:<br /><br />

<div class="poem">
<p>Those damned antipodes to common sense,</p>
<p>Those toils to Flecknoe, pr'ythee, tell me whence</p>
<p>Does all this mighty mass of dulness spring,</p>
<p>Which in such loads thou to the stage dost bring?</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="Limbe_2-4" name="Limbe_2-4"></a>There is a very flat and prosaic imitation of this sentiment in
the Duke of Buckingham's lines to Pope:<br /><br />

<div class="poem">
<p>And yet so wondrous, so sublime a thing</p>
<p>As the great Iliad, scarce could make me sing;</p>
<p>Except I justly could at once commend</p>
<p>A good companion, and as firm a friend;</p>
<p>One moral, or a mere well-natured deed,</p>
<p>Does all desert in sciences exceed.</p>

<p>True wit has seen its best days long ago;</p>
<p>It ne'er looked up, since we were dipt in show;</p>

<p>Nor stopt it here; when tragedy was done,</p>
<p>Satire and humour the same fate have run,</p>
<p>And comedy is sunk to trick and pun.</p>

<p class="sdn">Enter <span class="cnm">Woodall</span> and <span class="cnm">Gervase.</span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> Bid the footman receive the trunks and

you have taken for me, while I walk a turn here in
the garden.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Gerv.</span> It is already ordered, sir. But they are
like to stay in the outer-room, till the mistress of
the house return from morning exercise.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> What, she's gone to the parish church, it
seems, to her devotions!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Gerv.</span> No, sir; the servants have informed me,
that she rises every morning, and goes to a private
meeting-house; where they pray for the government,
and practise against the authority of it.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> And hast thou trepanned me into a tabernacle
of the godly? Is this pious boarding-house a
place for me, thou wicked varlet?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Gerv.</span> According to human appearance, I must
confess, it is neither fit for you, nor you for it; but
<span class="pgnm">016</span><a id="page_016" name="page_016"></a>
have patience, sir; matters are not so bad as they
may seem. There are pious bawdy-houses in the
world, or conventicles would not be so much frequented.
Neither is it impossible, but a devout
fanatic landlady of a boarding-house may be a bawd.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> Ay, to those of her own church, I grant
you, Gervase; but I am none of those.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Gerv.</span> If I were worthy to read you a lecture in
the mystery of wickedness, I would instruct you
first in the art of seeming holiness: But, heaven be
thanked, you have a toward and pregnant genius
to vice, and need not any man's instruction; and I
am too good, I thank my stars, for the vile employment
of a pimp.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> Then thou art even too good for me; a
worse man will serve my turn.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Gerv.</span> I call your conscience to witness, how
often I have given you wholesome counsel; how often
I have said to you, with tears in my eyes, master,
or master Aldo&mdash;</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> Mr Woodall, you rogue! that is my <i>nomme
de guerre.</i> You know I have laid by Aldo, for fear
that name should bring me to the notice of my father.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Gerv.</span> Cry you mercy, good Mr Woodall. How
often have I said,&mdash;Into what courses do you run!
Your father sent you into France at twelve years
old; bred you up at Paris, first in a college, and
then at an academy: At the first, instead of running
through a course of philosophy, you ran through
all the bawdy-houses in town: At the latter, instead
of managing the great horse, you exercised on
your master's wife. What you did in Germany, I
know not; but that you beat them all at their own
weapon, drinking, and have brought home a goblet
of plate from Munster, for the prize of swallowing a
gallon of Rhenish more than the bishop.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="pgnm">017</span><a id="page_017" name="page_017"></a>
<span class="cnm">Wood.</span> Gervase, thou shalt be my chronicler; thou
losest none of my heroic actions.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Gerv.</span> What a comfort are you like to prove to your
good old father! You have run a campaigning among
the French these last three years, without his leave;
and now he sends for you back, to settle you in
the world, and marry you to the heiress of a rich
gentleman, of whom he had the guardianship, yet
you do not make your application to him.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> Pr'ythee, no more.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Gerv.</span> You are come over, have been in town
above a week <i>incognito</i>, haunting play-houses, and
other places, which for modesty I name not; and
have changed your name from Aldo to Woodall, for
fear of being discovered to him: You have not so
much as inquired where he is lodged, though you
know he is most commonly in London: And lastly,
you have discharged my honest fellow-servant Giles,
because&mdash;</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> Because he was too saucy, and was ever
offering to give me counsel: Mark that, and tremble
at his destiny.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Gerv.</span> I know the reason why I am kept;
because you cannot be discovered by my means; for
you took me up in France, and your father knows
me not.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> I must have a ramble in the town: When
I have spent my money, I will grow dutiful, see
my father, and ask for more. In the mean time, I
have beheld a handsome woman at a play, I am
fallen in love with her, and have found her easy:
Thou, I thank thee, hast traced her to her lodging
in this boarding-house, and hither I am come, to
accomplish my design.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Gerv.</span> Well, heaven mend all. I hear our landlady's
voice without; [<span class="sdm">Noise.</span>] and therefore shall defer
my counsel to a fitter season.</p>

<p class="dlg">Is this the lady of the house?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> One I know, indeed; a wife: But <i>bona
roba's</i>, say you?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> I say, <i>bona roba's</i>, in the plural number.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> Why, what a Turk Mahomet shall I be!
No, I will not make myself drunk with the conceit
of so much joy: The fortune's too great for mortal
man; and I a poor unworthy sinner.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> Would I lie to my friend? Am I a man?
Am I a christian? There is that wife you mentioned,
<span class="pgnm">022</span><a id="page_022" name="page_022"></a>
a delicate little wheedling devil, with such an appearance
of simplicity; and with that, she does so
undermine, so fool her conceited husband, that he
despises her!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> Just ripe for horns: His destiny, like a
Turk's, is written in his forehead.<a class="ftnt" href="#Limbe_3-1">[1]</a></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> Peace, peace! thou art yet ordained for
greater things. There is another, too, a kept mistress,
a brave strapping jade, a two-handed whore!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> A kept mistress, too! my bowels yearn to
her already: she is certain prize.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> But this lady is so termagant an empress!
and he is so submissive, so tame, so led a keeper, and as
proud of his slavery as a Frenchman. I am confident
he dares not find her false, for fear of a quarrel
with her; because he is sure to be at the charges
of the war. She knows he cannot live without her,
and therefore seeks occasions of falling out, to make
him purchase peace. I believe she is now aiming
at a settlement.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> Might not I ask you one civil question?
How pass you your time in this noble family? For
I find you are a lover of the game, and I should be
loth to hunt in your purlieus.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> I must first tell you something of my condition.
I am here a friend to all of them; I am their
<i>factotum</i>, do all their business; for, not to boast,
sir, I am a man of general acquaintance: There is
no news in town, either foreign or domestic, but I
have it first; no mortgage of lands, no sale of houses,
but I have a finger in them.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="pgnm">023</span><a id="page_023" name="page_023"></a>
<span class="cnm">Wood.</span> Then, I suppose, you are a gainer by your
pains.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> No, I do all <i>gratis</i>, and am most commonly
a loser; only a buck sometimes from this good
lord, or that good lady in the country: and I eat
it not alone, I must have company.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> Pray, what company do you invite?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> Peace, peace, I am coming to you: Why,
you must know I am tender-natured; and if any
unhappy difference have arisen betwixt a mistress
and her gallant, then I strike in, to do good offices
betwixt them; and, at my own proper charges,
conclude the quarrel with a reconciling supper.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> I find the ladies of pleasure are beholden
to you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> Before George, I love the poor little devils.
I am indeed a father to them, and so they call me:
I give them my counsel, and assist them with my
purse. I cannot see a pretty sinner hurried to prison
by the land-pirates, but nature works, and I
must bail her; or want a supper, but I have a couple
of crammed chickens, a cream tart, and a bottle
of wine to offer her.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> Sure you expect some kindness in return.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> Faith, not much: Nature in me is at low
water-mark; my body's a jade, and tires under me;
yet I love to smuggle still in a corner; pat them
down, and pur over them; but, after that, I can do
them little harm.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> Then I'm acquainted with your business:
You would be a kind of deputy-fumbler under me.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> You have me right. Be you the lion, to
devour the prey; I am your jackall, to provide it
for you: There will be a bone for me to pick.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> Your humility becomes your age. For my
part, I am vigorous, and throw at all.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="pgnm">024</span><a id="page_024" name="page_024"></a>
<span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> As right as if I had begot thee! Wilt thou
give me leave to call thee son?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> With all my heart.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> Ha, mad son!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> Mad daddy!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> Your man told me, you were just returned
from travel: What parts have you last visited?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> I came from France.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> Then, perhaps, you may have known an
ungracious boy of mine there.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> Like enough: Pray, what's his name?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> George Aldo.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> I must confess I do know the gentleman;
satisfy yourself, he's in health, and upon his return.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> That's some comfort: But, I hear, a very
rogue, a lewd young fellow.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> The worst I know of him is, that he loves
a wench; and that good quality he has not stolen.
[<span class="sdm">Music at the Balcony over head: Mrs <span class="cnm">Tricksy</span> and
<span class="cnm">Judith</span> appear.</span>]&mdash;Hark! There's music above.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> 'Tis at my daughter Tricksy's lodging; the
kept mistress I told you of, the lass of mettle. But
for all she carries it so high, I know her pedigree;
her mother's a sempstress in Dog-and-Bitch yard, and
was, in her youth, as right as she is.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> Then she's a two-piled punk, a punk of
two descents.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> And her father, the famous cobler, who
taught Walsingham to the black-birds. How stand
thy affections to her, thou lusty rogue?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> All on fire: A most urging creature!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> Peace! they are beginning.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Trick.</span> [<span class="sdm">Above.</span>] Father, father Aldo!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> Daughter Tricksy, are you there, child?
your friends at Barnet are all well, and your dear

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Trick.</span> You will never leave these fumbling tricks,

sure you would own it, for your credit.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> Before George, I should not see it starve,
for the mother's sake: For, if she were a punk, she
was good-natured, I warrant her.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> [<span class="sdm">Aside.</span>] Well, if ever son was blest with a

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Trick.</span> Who is that gentleman with you?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> A young <i>monsieur</i> returned from travel; a

him tell you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="pgnm">027</span><a id="page_027" name="page_027"></a>
<span class="cnm">Wood.</span> [<span class="sdm">Aside.</span>] Are you gloating already? then

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Trick.</span> You seem to know him, father.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> Know him! from his cradle&mdash;What's your

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> Woodall.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ald.</span> Woodall of Woodall; I knew his father;
we were contemporaries, and fellow-wenchers in
our youth.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> [<span class="sdm">Aside.</span>] My honest father stumbles into
truth, in spite of lying.</p>

before you came.<span class="sdr">[<span class="cnm">Tricksy</span> descends.</span></p>

<span class="sdr">[Exit.</span><br /></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> [<span class="sdm">Alone.</span>] 'Twas my study to avoid my father,
and I have run full into his mouth: and yet I
have a strong hank upon him too; for I am privy
to as many of his virtues, as he is of mine. After
all, if I had an ounce of discretion left, I should
pursue this business no farther: but two fine women
in a house! well, it is resolved, come what will on

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Trick.</span> [<span class="sdm">Aside.</span>] What a difference there is between
this gentleman, and my feeble keeper, Mr Limberham!
he's to my wish, if he would but make the
least advances to me.&mdash;Father Aldo tells me, sir, you
are a traveller: What adventures have you had in
foreign countries?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> I have no adventures of my own, can deserve
your curiosity; but, now I think on it, I can
<span class="pgnm">028</span><a id="page_028" name="page_028"></a>
tell you one that happened to a French cavalier, a
friend of mine, at Tripoli.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Trick.</span> No wars, I beseech you: I am so weary of
father Aldo's Loraine and Crequi.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> Then this is as you would desire it, a
love-adventure. This French gentleman was made a slave
to the Dey of Tripoli; by his good qualities, gained
his master's favour; and after, by corrupting an
eunuch, was brought into the seraglio privately,
to see the Dey's mistress.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Trick.</span> This is somewhat; proceed, sweet sir.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> He was so much amazed, when he first beheld
her leaning over a balcony, that he scarcely
dared to lift his eyes, or speak to her.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Trick.</span> [<span class="sdm">Aside.</span>] I find him now.&mdash;But what followed
of this dumb interview?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> The nymph was gracious, and came down
to him; but with so goddess-like a presence, that
the poor gentleman was thunder-struck again.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Trick.</span> That savoured little of the monsieur's gallantry,
especially when the lady gave him encouragement.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood</span> The gentleman was not so dull, but he
understood the favour, and was presuming enough
to try if she were mortal. He advanced with more
assurance, and took her fair hands: was he not too
bold, madam? and would not you have drawn back
yours, had you been in the sultana's place?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Trick.</span> If the sultana liked him well enough to
come down into the garden to him, I suppose she
came not thither to gather nosegays.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> Give me leave, madam, to thank you, in
my friend's behalf, for your favourable judgment.
[<span class="sdm">Kisses her hand.</span>] He kissed her hand with an exceeding
transport; and finding that she prest his at
the same instant, he proceeded with a greater eagerness
to her lips&mdash;but, madam, the story would be
<span class="pgnm">029</span><a id="page_029" name="page_029"></a>
without life, unless you give me leave to act the
circumstances.<br />
<span class="sdr">[Kisses her.</span><br /></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Trick.</span> Well, I'll swear you are the most natural
historian!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> But now, madam, my heart beats with joy,
when I come to tell you the sweetest part of his
adventure: opportunity was favourable, and love
was on his side; he told her, the chamber was more
private, and a fitter scene for pleasure. Then, looking
on her eyes, he found them languishing; he saw
her cheeks blushing, and heard her voice faultering
in a half-denial: he seized her hand with an amorous
ecstacy, and&mdash;<br />
<span class="sdr">[Takes her hand.</span><br /></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Trick.</span> Hold, sir, you act your part too far. Your
friend was unconscionable, if he desired more favours
at the first interview.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> He both desired and obtained them, madam,
and so will&mdash;</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Trick.</span> [<span class="sdm">A noise within.</span>] Heavens! I hear Mr Limberham's
voice: he's returned from Barnet.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> I'll avoid him.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Trick.</span> That's impossible; he'll meet you. Let me
think a moment:&mdash;Mrs Saintly is abroad, and cannot
discover you: have any of the servants seen you?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> None.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Trick.</span> Then you shall pass for my Italian merchant
of essences: here's a little box of them just
ready.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> But I speak no Italian; only a few broken
scraps, which I picked from Scaramouch and Harlequin
at Paris.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Trick.</span> You must venture that: When we are rid
of Limberham, 'tis but slipping into your chamber,
throwing off your black perriwig, and riding suit,
and you come out an Englishman. No more; he's
here.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Limb.</span> I have put myself into this same unsavoury

Before George, as father Aldo says, I could not live
without thee; thou art the purest bed-fellow, though
I say it, that I did nothing but dream of thee all
night; and then I was so troublesome to father Aldo,
(for you must know he and I were lodged together)
that, in my conscience, I did so kiss him,
and so hug him in my sleep!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Trick.</span> I dare be sworn 'twas in your sleep; for,

quiet bed-fellow, that ever lay by woman.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Limb.</span> Well, Pug, all shall be amended; I am

I would make a present of your essences to

fairies in the Alchemist<a class="ftnt" href="#Limbe_3-4">[4]</a>. I have escaped, thanks
<span class="pgnm">033</span><a id="page_033" name="page_033"></a>
to my mistress's <i>lingua Fran&ccedil;a</i>: I'll steal to my
chamber, shift my perriwig and clothes; and then,
with the help of resty Gervase, concert the business
of the next campaign. My father sticks in my
stomach still; but I am resolved to be Woodall with
him, and Aldo with the women.<br />

<h4 class="scn">ACT II. SCENE I.</h4>

<p class="sdn">Enter <span class="cnm">Woodall</span> and <span class="cnm">Gervase.</span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> Hitherto, sweet Gervase, we have carried
matters swimmingly. I have danced in a net before
my father, almost check-mated the keeper, retired
to my chamber undiscovered, shifted my habit,
and am come out an absolute monsieur, to allure
the ladies. How sits my <i>chedreux</i>?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Gerv.</span> O very finely! with the locks combed
down, like a mermaid's on a sign-post. Well, you
think now your father may live in the same house
with you till doomsday, and never find you; or,
when he has found you, he will be kind enough not
to consider what a property you have made of him.
My employment is at an end; you have got a better
pimp, thanks to your filial reverence.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> Pr'ythee, what should a man do with such
a father, but use him thus? besides, he does journey-work
under me; 'tis his humour to fumble, and
my duty to provide for his old age.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Gerv.</span> Take my advice yet; down o' your marrow
bones, and ask forgiveness; espouse the wife
he has provided for you; lie by the side of a wholesome
woman, and procreate your own progeny in
the fear of heaven.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> I have no vocation to it, Gervase: A man
of sense is not made for marriage; 'tis a game,
<span class="pgnm">034</span><a id="page_034" name="page_034"></a>
which none but dull plodding fellows can play at
well; and 'tis as natural to them, as crimp is to a
Dutchman.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Gerv.</span> Think on't, however, sir; debauchery is
upon its last legs in England: Witty men began the
fashion, and now the fops are got into it, 'tis time
to leave it.</p>

<p class="sdn">Enter <span class="cnm">Aldo.</span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> Son Woodall, thou vigorous young rogue,
I congratulate thy good fortune; thy man has told
me the adventure of the Italian merchant.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> Well, they are now retired together, like
Rinaldo and Armida, to private dalliance; but
we shall find a time to separate their loves, and
strike in betwixt them, daddy. But I hear there's
another lady in the house, my landlady's fair daughter;
how came you to leave her out of your catalogue?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> She's pretty, I confess, but most damnably
honest; have a care of her, I warn you, for she's
prying and malicious.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> A twang of the mother; but I love to
graff on such a crab-tree; she may bear good fruit
another year.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> No, no, avoid her; I warrant thee, young
Alexander, I will provide thee more worlds to conquer.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Gerv.</span> [<span class="sdm">Aside.</span>] My old master would fain pass
for Philip of Macedon, when he is little better than
Sir Pandarus of Troy.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> If you get this keeper out of doors, father,
and give me but an opportunity&mdash;</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> Trust my diligence; I will smoke him
out, as they do bees, but I will make him leave his
honey-comb.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Gerv.</span> [<span class="sdm">Aside.</span>] If I had a thousand sons, none of
<span class="pgnm">035</span><a id="page_035" name="page_035"></a>
the race of the Gervases should ever be educated by
thee, thou vile old Satan!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> Away, boy! Fix thy arms, and whet, like
the lusty German boys, before a charge: He shall
bolt immediately.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> O, fear not the vigorous five-and-twenty.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> Hold, a word first: Thou saidst my son
was shortly to come over.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> So he told me.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> Thou art my bosom friend.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Gerv.</span> [<span class="sdm">Aside.</span>] Of an hour's acquaintance.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> Be sure thou dost not discover my frailties
to the young scoundrel: 'Twere enough to make
the boy my master. I must keep up the dignity
of old age with him.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> Keep but your own counsel, father; for
whatever he knows, must come from you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> The truth on't is, I sent for him over;
partly to have married him, and partly because his
villainous bills came so thick upon me, that I grew
weary of the charge.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Gerv.</span> He spared for nothing; he laid it on, sir,
as I have heard.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> Peace, you lying rogue!&mdash;Believe me, sir,
bating his necessary expences of women, which I
know you would not have him want, in all things
else, he was the best manager of your allowance;
and, though I say it&mdash;</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Gerv.</span> [<span class="sdm">Aside.</span>] That should not say it.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> The most hopeful young gentleman in
Paris.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> Report speaks otherwise; and, before
George, I shall read him a wormwood lecture,
when I see him. But, hark, I hear the door unlock;
the lovers are coming out: I'll stay here, to
wheedle him abroad; but you must vanish.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Limb.</span> Nay, but dear sweet honey Pug, forgive

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Trick.</span> Father Aldo! I wonder you are not ashamed

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> Before George, I smell a rat, son Limberham.
I doubt, I doubt, here has been some great
omission in love affairs.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Limb.</span> I think all the stars in heaven have conspired
my ruin. I'll look in my almanack.&mdash;As I

what offers I have had, and what fortunes I might
have made with others, like a fool as I was, to throw

away my youth and beauty upon you. I could
have had a young handsome lord, that offered me
my coach and six; besides many a good knight and
gentleman, that would have parted with their own
ladies, and have settled half they had upon me.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Limb.</span> Ay, you said so.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Trick.</span> I said so, sir! Who am I? Is not my word
as good as yours?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Limb.</span> As mine gentlewoman? though I say it,
my word will go for thousands.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Trick.</span> The more shame for you, that you have
done no more for me: But I am resolved I'll not
lose my time with you; I'll part.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Limb.</span> Do, who cares? Go to Dog-and-Bitch yard,

gets half way over to Calais.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> Nay, but son Limberham, this must not
be. A word in private;&mdash;you will never get such
another woman, for love nor money. Do but look
upon her; she is a mistress for an emperor.</p>

whore of Babylon, as she is.</p>

them.</p>

child, you will scarcely find so kind a keeper. What
if he has some impediment one way? Every body

to supply his wants; but, as long as he maintains
you, be ruled by him that bears the purse.</p>

to-morrow. Love may die upon our hands, or opportunity
be wanting; 'tis best securing the present

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Trick.</span> No, love's like fruit; it must have time to
ripen on the tree; if it be green gathered, 'twill but
wither afterwards.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> Rather 'tis like gun powder; that which
fires quickest, is commonly the strongest.&mdash;By this
burning kiss&mdash;</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Trick.</span> You lovers are such froward children, ever
crying for the breast; and, when you have once
had it, fall fast asleep in the nurse's arms. And
with what face should I look upon my keeper after
it?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> With the same face that all mistresses look

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Trick.</span> But my reputation!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> Nay, that's no argument, if I should be so

Your honour is, in other words, but your good repute;

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> Nay, you shall excuse me for that; but we

Woodall.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Limb.</span> Before George, and so it is.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> Carry me this letter, quoth he, to your son

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Limb.</span> What, are you not acquainted with the

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Mrs Over.</span> A very small matter, by my troth;
considering the charges I have been at in her education:
Poor Prue was born under an unlucky
planet; I despair of a coach for her. Her first
maiden-head brought me in but little, the weather-beaten
old knight, that bought her of me, beat down
the price so low. I held her at an hundred guineas,
and he bid ten; and higher than thirty would not
rise.</p>

comes every day to our house, and eats out his
thirty guineas; and at three months end, he threw
me off.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Mrs Over.</span> And since then, the poor child has
dwindled, and dwindled away. Her next maiden-head

five; and at last to a single guinea: She has no
luck to keeping; they all leave her, the more my
sorrow.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> We must get her a husband then in the

end of the town, new furbished up in a tawdry

that the adventure of the garden-house, last night,

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Jud.</span> But one. You must excuse my unbelief,
though Mrs Brainsick is better satisfied. She and
her husband, you know, went out this morning to

her stays for a new gown&mdash;</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Giles.</span> Why, this is he, sir; I thought you had
known him.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> Known whom?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Giles.</span> Your son here, my young master.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> Do I dote? or art thou drunk, Giles?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="pgnm">108</span><a id="page_108" name="page_108"></a>
<span class="cnm">Giles.</span> Nay, I am sober enough, I'm sure; I have
been kept fasting almost these two days.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> Before George, 'tis so! I read it in that
leering look: What a Tartar have I caught!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Brain.</span> Woodall his son!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pleas.</span> What, young father Aldo!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> [<span class="sdm">Aside.</span>] Now cannot I for shame hold up
my head, to think what this young rogue is privy
to!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Mrs Brain.</span> The most dumb interview I ever
saw!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Brain.</span> What, have you beheld the Gorgon's head
on either side?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> Oh, my sins! my sins! and he keeps my
book of conscience too! He can display them, with
a witness! Oh, treacherous young devil!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> [<span class="sdm">Aside.</span>] Well, the squib's run to the end of
the line, and now for the cracker: I must bear up.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> I must set a face of authority on the matter,
for my credit.&mdash;Pray, who am I? do you
know me, sir?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> Yes, I think I should partly know you,
sir: You may remember some private passages betwixt
us.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> [<span class="sdm">Aside.</span>] I thought as much; he has me already!&mdash;But
pray, sir, why this ceremony amongst
friends? Put on, put on; and let us hear what news
from France. Have you heard lately from my son?
does he continue still the most hopeful and esteemed
young gentleman in Paris? does he manage his allowance
with the same discretion? and, lastly, has
he still the same respect and duty for his good old
father?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> Faith, sir, I have been too long from my
catechism, to answer so many questions; but, suppose
there be no news of your <i>quondam</i> son, you
may comfort up your heart for such a loss; father
<span class="pgnm">109</span><a id="page_109" name="page_109"></a>
Aldo has a numerous progeny about the town,
heaven bless them.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> It is very well, sir; I find you have been
searching for your relations, then, in Whetstone's
Park<a class="ftnt" href="#Limbe_3-14">[14]</a>!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> No, sir; I made some scruple of going to
the foresaid place, for fear of meeting my own father
there.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> Before George, I could find in my heart to
disinherit thee.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pleas.</span> Sure you cannot be so unnatural.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> I am sure I am no bastard; witness one
good quality I have. If any of your children have a
stronger tang of the father in them, I am content
to be disowned.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> Well, from this time forward, I pronounce
thee&mdash;no son of mine.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> Then you desire I should proceed to justify
I am lawfully begotten? The evidence is ready,
sir; and, if you please, I shall relate, before this honourable
assembly, those excellent lessons of morality
you gave me at our first acquaintance. As, in
the first place&mdash;</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> Hold, hold; I charge thee hold, on thy
obedience. I forgive thee heartily: I have proof
enough thou art my son; but tame thee that can,
thou art a mad one.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pleas.</span> Why this is as it should be.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> [<span class="sdm">To him.</span>] Not a word of any passages betwixt
us; it is enough we know each other; hereafter
<span class="pgnm">110</span><a id="page_110" name="page_110"></a>
we will banish all pomp and ceremony, and
live familiarly together. I'll be Pylades, and thou
mad Orestes, and we will divide the estate betwixt
us, and have fresh wenches, and <i>ballum rankum</i>
every night.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> A match, i'faith: and let the world pass.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> But hold a little; I had forgot one point:
I hope you are not married, nor engaged?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> To nothing but my pleasures, I.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> A mingle of profit would do well though.
Come, here is a girl; look well upon her; it is a
mettled toad, I can tell you that: She will make
notable work betwixt two sheets, in a lawful way.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> What, my old enemy, Mrs Pleasance!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Mrs Brain.</span> Marry Mrs Saintly's daughter!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> The truth is, she has past for her daughter,
by my appointment; but she has as good blood
running in her veins, as the best of you. Her father,
Mr Palms, on his death-bed, left her to my care and
disposal, besides a fortune of twelve hundred a
year; a pretty convenience, by my faith.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> Beyond my hopes, if she consent.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> I have taken some care of her education,
and placed her here with Mrs Saintly, as her daughter,
to avoid her being blown upon by fops, and
younger brothers. So now, son, I hope I have
matched your concealment with my discovery;
there is hit for hit, ere I cross the cudgels.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pleas.</span> You will not take them up, sir?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> I dare not against you, madam: I am
sure you will worst me at all weapons. All I can
say is, I do not now begin to love you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> Let me speak for thee: Thou shalt be used,
little Pleasance, like a sovereign princess: Thou
shalt not touch a bit of butchers' meat in a twelve-month;
and thou shall be treated&mdash;</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="pgnm">111</span><a id="page_111" name="page_111"></a>
<span class="cnm">Pleas.</span> Not with <i>ballum rankum</i> every night, I
hope!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> Well, thou art a wag; no more of that.
Thou shall want neither man's meat, nor woman's
meat, as far as his provision will hold out.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pleas.</span> But I fear he is so horribly given to go a
house-warming abroad, that the least part of the provision
will come to my share at home.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> You will find me so much employment in
my own family, that I shall have little need to look
out for journey-work.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aldo.</span> Before George, he shall do thee reason, ere
thou sleepest.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pleas.</span> No; he shall have an honourable truce for
one day at least; for it is not fair to put a fresh
enemy upon him.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Mrs Brain.</span> [<span class="sdm">To <span class="cnm">Pleas.</span></span>] I beseech you, madam,
discover nothing betwixt him and me.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pleas.</span> [<span class="sdm">To her.</span>] I am contented to cancel the

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Gerv.</span> Give good words, while you live, sir; your

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> Nay, do not insult too much, good Mr

the widow intended it to me.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Gerv.</span> But I am satisfied she performed it with

Look, an' she does not blush now! you

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Wood.</span> Sir, I should now make a speech to you

If you can forgive what is past, your hand, and

the satisfaction of a gentleman.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Limb.</span> Sir, I am a peaceable man, and a good

not to make a chapel-of-ease of Pug's closet.</p>

<h3 class="chap">&OElig;DIPUS.</h3>

<p>The dreadful subject of this piece has been celebrated by several
ancient and modern dramatists. Of seven tragedies of Sophocles
which have reached our times, two are founded on the history
of &OElig;dipus. The first of these, called "&OElig;dipus Tyrannus," has
been extolled by every critic since the days of Aristotle, for the
unparalleled art with which the story is managed. The dreadful
secret, the existence of which is announced by the pestilence, and
by the wrath of the offended deities, seems each moment on the
verge of being explained, yet, till the last act, the reader is still
held in horrible suspense. Every circumstance, resorted to for the
purpose of evincing the falsehood of the oracle, tends gradually
to confirm the guilt of &OElig;dipus, and to accelerate the catastrophe;
while his own supposed consciousness of innocence, at once
interests us in his favour, and precipitates the horrible discovery.
Dryden, who arranged the whole plan of the following
tragedy, although assisted by Lee in the execution, was fully
aware of the merit of the "&OElig;dipus Tyrannus;" and, with the
addition of the under-plot of Adrastus and Eurydice, has traced out
the events of the drama, in close imitation of Sophocles. The
Grecian bard, however, in concurrence with the history or tradition
of Greece, has made &OElig;dipus survive the discovery of his unintentional
guilt, and reserved him, in blindness and banishment,
for the subject of his second tragedy of "&OElig;dipus Coloneus." This
may have been well judged, considering that the audience were
intimately acquainted with the important scenes which were to
follow among the descendants of &OElig;dipus, with the first and second
wars against Thebes, and her final conquest by the ancestors
of those Athenians, before whom the play was rehearsed, led
on by their demi-god Theseus. They were also prepared to receive,
with reverence and faith, the belief on which the whole interest
turns, that if &OElig;dipus should be restored to Thebes, the vengeance
of the gods against the devoted city might be averted; and to applaud
his determination to remain on Athenian ground, that the predestined
curse might descend on his unnatural sons and ungrateful
country. But while the modern reader admires the lofty tone of poetry
and high strain of morality which pervades "&OElig;dipus Coloneus,"
it must appear more natural to his feelings, that the life of
<span class="pgnm">118</span><a id="page_118" name="page_118"></a>
the hero, stained with unintentional incest and parricide, should
be terminated, as in Dryden's play, upon the discovery of his complicated
guilt and wretchedness. Yet there is something awful in the
idea of the monarch, blind and exiled, innocent in intention, though
so horribly criminal in fact, devoted, as it were, to the infernal deities,
and sacred from human power and violence by the very excess
of his guilt and misery. The account of the death of &OElig;dipus Coloneus
reaches the highest tone of sublimity. While the lightning
flashes around him, he expresses the feeling, that his hour is come;
and the reader anticipates, that, like Malefort in the "Unnatural
Combat," he is to perish by a thunder-bolt. Yet, for the awful
catastrophe, which we are artfully led to expect, is substituted a
mysterious termination, still more awful. &OElig;dipus arrays himself
in splendid apparel, and dismisses his daughters and the attending
Athenians. Theseus alone remains with him. The storm subsides,
and the attendants return to the place, but &OElig;dipus is there
no longer&mdash;he had not perished by water, by sword, nor by fire&mdash;no
one but Theseus knew the manner of his death. With an impressive
hint, that it was as strange and wonderful as his life had been
dismally eventful, the poet drops a curtain over the fate of his
hero. This last sublime scene Dryden has not ventured to imitate;
and the rants of Lee are a poor substitute for the calm and
determined despair of the "&OElig;dipus Coloneus."</p>

<p>Seneca, perhaps to check the seeds of vice in Nero, his pupil,
to whom incest and blood were afterwards so familiar<a class="ftnt" href="#OEdip_1-1">[1]</a>, composed
the Latin tragedy on the subject of &OElig;dipus, which is alluded to by
Dryden in the following preface. The cold declamatory rhetorical
stile of that philosopher was adapted precisely to counteract
the effect, which a tale of terror produces on the feelings and
imagination. His taste exerted itself in filling up and garnishing
the more trifling passages, which Sophocles had passed over as unworthy
of notice, and in adjusting incidents laid in the heroic age
of Grecian simplicity, according to the taste and customs of the
court of Nero<a class="ftnt" href="#OEdip_1-2">[2]</a>. Yet though devoid of dramatic effect, of
fancy, and of genius, the &OElig;dipus of Seneca displays the masculine
eloquence and high moral sentiment of its author; and if
it does not interest us in the scene of fiction, it often compels us
to turn our thoughts inward, and to study our own hearts.</p>

<p><span class="pgnm">119</span><a id="page_119" name="page_119"></a>
The &OElig;dipe of Corneille is in all respects unworthy of its great
author. The poet considering, as he states in his introduction,
that the subject of &OElig;dipus tearing out his eyes was too horrible
to be presented before ladies, qualifies its terrors by the introduction
of a love intrigue betwixt Theseus and Dirce. The unhappy
propensity of the French poets to introduce long discussions upon
<i>la belle passion</i>, addressed merely to the understanding, without
respect to feeling or propriety, is nowhere more ridiculously displayed
than in "&OElig;dipe." The play opens with the following polite
speech of Theseus to Dirce:</p>

<div class="poem pi">
<p>N'ecoutez plus, madame, une pitie cruelle,</p>
<p>Qui d'un fidel amant vous ferait un rebelle:</p>
<p>La gloire d'obeir n'a rien que me soit doux,</p>
<p>Lorsque vous m'ordonnez de m'eloigner de vous.</p>
<p>Quelque ravage affreux qu'etale ici la peste,</p>
<p>L'absence aux vrais amans est encore plus funeste;</p>
<p>Et d'un si grand peril l'image s'offre en vain,</p>
<p>Quand ce peril douteux epargne un mal certain.</p>
<p class="citation" style="font-style: normal;">Act premiere, Scene premiere.</p>
</div>

<p>It is hardly possible more prettily to jingle upon the <i>peril douteux</i>,
and the <i>mal certain</i>; but this is rather an awkward way of introducing
the account of the pestilence, with which all the other
dramatists have opened their scene. &OElig;dipus, however, is at once
sensible of the cause which detained Theseus at his melancholy
court, amidst the horrors of the plague:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p><i>Je l'avais bien juge qu'</i> un interet d'amour</p>
<p><i>Fermait ici vos yeux aux perils de ma cour.</i></p>
</div>

<p class="noind"><i>&OElig;dipo conjectere opus est</i>&mdash;it would have been difficult for any
other person to have divined such a motive. The conduct of the
drama is exactly suitable to its commencement; the fate of &OElig;dipus
and of Thebes, the ravages of the pestilence, and the avenging
of the death of Laius, are all secondary and subordinate considerations
to the loves of Theseus and Dirce, as flat and uninteresting
a pair as ever spoke <i>platitudes</i> in French hexameters.
So much is this the engrossing subject of the drama, that &OElig;dipus,
at the very moment when Tiresias is supposed to be engaged in
raising the ghost of Laius, occupies himself in a long scene of
scolding about love and duty with Dirce; and it is not till he is
almost bullied by her off the stage, that he suddenly recollects,
as an apology for his retreat,</p>

<div class="poem pi">
<p>Mais il faut aller voir ce qu'a fait Tiresias.</p>
</div>

<p>Considering, however, the declamatory nature of the French
dialogue, and the peremptory rule of their drama, that love, or
rather gallantry, must be the moving principle of every performance,
<span class="pgnm">120</span><a id="page_120" name="page_120"></a>
it is more astonishing that Corneille should have chosen so masculine
and agitating a subject, than that he should have failed in
treating it with propriety or success.</p>

<p>In the following tragedy, Dryden has avowedly adopted the
Greek model; qualified, however, by the under plot of Adrastus
and Eurydice, which contributes little either to the effect or merit
of the play. Creon, in his ambition and his deformity, is a poor
copy of Richard III., without his abilities; his plots and treasons
are baffled by the single appearance of &OElig;dipus; and as for the
loves and woes of Eurydice, and the prince of Argos, they are lost
in the horrors of the principal story, like the moonlight amid the
glare of a conflagration. In other respects, the conduct of the
piece closely follows the "&OElig;dipus Tyrannus," and, in some respects,
even improves on that excellent model. The Tiresias of Sophocles,
for example, upon his first introduction, denounces &OElig;dipus as
the slayer of Laius, braves his resentment, and prophesies his miserable
catastrophe. In Dryden's play, the first anathema of the
prophet is levelled only against the unknown murderer; and it is
not till the powers of hell have been invoked, that even the eye
of the prophet can penetrate the horrible veil, and fix the guilt
decisively upon &OElig;dipus. By this means, the striking quarrel betwixt
the monarch and Tiresias is, with great art, postponed to
the third act; and the interest, of course, is more gradually heightened
than in the Grecian tragedy.</p>

<p>The first and third acts, which were wholly written by Dryden,
maintain a decided superiority over the rest of the piece. Yet
there are many excellent passages scattered through Lee's scenes;
and as the whole was probably corrected by Dryden, the tragedy
has the appearance of general consistence and uniformity. There
are several scenes, in which Dryden seems to have indulged his
newly adopted desire of imitating the stile of Shakespeare. Such
are, in particular, the scene of &OElig;dipus walking in his sleep,
which bears marks of Dryden's pen; and such, also, is the incantation
in the third act. Seneca and Corneille have thrown this
last scene into narrative. Yet, by the present large size of our
stages, and the complete management of light and shade, the incantation
might be represented with striking effect; an advantage
which, I fear, has been gained by the sacrifice of others, much
more essential to the drama, considered as a dignified and rational
amusement. The incantation itself is nobly written, and
the ghost of Laius can only be paralleled in Shakespeare.</p>

<p>The language of &OElig;dipus is, in general, nervous, pure, and elegant;
and the dialogue, though in so high a tone of passion, is
natural and affecting. Some of Lee's extravagancies are lamentable
exceptions to this observation. This may be instanced in the
passage, where Jocasta threatens to fire Olympus, destroy the heavenly
<span class="pgnm">121</span><a id="page_121" name="page_121"></a>
furniture, and smoke the deities <i>like bees out of their ambrosial
hives</i>; and such is the still more noted wish of &OElig;dipus;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>Through all the inmost chambers of the sky,</p>
<p>May there not be a glimpse, one starry spark,</p>
<p>But gods meet gods, and jostle in the dark!</p>
</div>

<p>These blemishes, however, are entitled to some indulgence from
the reader, when they occur in a work of real genius. Those, who
do not strive at excellence, will seldom fall into absurdity; as he,
who is contented to walk, is little liable to stumble.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the admirable disposition of the parts of this
play, the gradual increase of the interest, and the strong impassioned
language of the dialogue, the disagreeable nature of the
plot forms an objection to its success upon a British stage. Distress,
which turns upon the involutions of unnatural or incestuous
passion, carries with it something too disgusting for the sympathy
of a refined age; whereas, in a simple state of society, the feelings
require a more powerful stimulus; as we see the vulgar crowd
round an object of real horror, with the same pleasure we reap
from seeing it represented on a theatre. Besides, in ancient times,
in those of the Roman empire at least, such abominations really
occurred, as sanctioned the story of &OElig;dipus. But the change of
manners has introduced not only greater purity of moral feeling,
but a sensibility, which retreats with abhorrence even from a
fiction turning upon such circumstances. Hence, Garrick, who
well knew the taste of an English audience, renounced his intention
of reviving the excellent old play of "King and no King;"
and hence Massinger's still more awful tragedy of "The Unnatural
Combat," has been justly deemed unfit for a modern stage.
Independent of this disgusting circumstance, it may be questioned
Whether the horror of this tragedy is not too powerful for
furnishing mere amusement? It is said in the "Companion to the
Playhouse," that when the piece was performing at Dublin, a musician,
in the orchestra, was so powerfully affected by the madness
of &OElig;dipus, as to become himself actually delirious: and though
this may be exaggerated, it is certain, that, when the play was revived
about thirty years ago, the audience were unable to support
it to an end; the boxes being all emptied before the third act was
concluded. Among all our English plays, there is none more determinedly
bloody than "&OElig;dipus," in its progress and conclusion.
The entrance of the unfortunate king, with his eyes torn from
their sockets, is too disgusting for representation<a class="ftnt" href="#OEdip_1-3">[3]</a>. Of all the
<span class="pgnm">122</span><a id="page_122" name="page_122"></a>
persons of the drama, scarce one survives the fifth act. &OElig;dipus
dashes out his brains, Jocasta stabs herself, their children are
strangled, Creon kills Eurydice, Adrastus kills Creon, and the
insurgents kill Adrastus; when we add to this, that the conspirators
are hanged, the reader will perceive, that the play, which
began with a pestilence, concludes with a massacre,</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>And darkness is the burier of the dead.</p>
</div>

<p>Another objection to &OElig;dipus has been derived from the doctrine
of fatalism, inculcated by the story. There is something of
cant in talking much upon the influence of a theatre on public
morals; yet, I fear, though the most moral plays are incapable
of doing much good, the turn of others may make a mischievous
impression, by embodying in verse, and rendering apt for the memory,
maxims of an impious or profligate tendency. In this
point of view, there is, at least, no edification in beholding the horrible
crimes unto which &OElig;dipus is unwillingly plunged, and in
witnessing the dreadful punishment he sustains, though innocent
of all moral or intentional guilt, Corneille has endeavoured to
counterbalance the obvious conclusion, by a long tirade upon free-will,
which I have subjoined, as it contains some striking ideas.<a class="ftnt" href="#OEdip_1-4">[4]</a>
But the doctrine, which it expresses, is contradictory of the whole
<span class="pgnm">123</span><a id="page_123" name="page_123"></a>
tenor of the story; and the correct deduction is much more justly
summed up by Seneca, in the stoical maxim of necessity:</p>

<div class="poem pi">
<p>Fatis agimur, cedite Fatis;</p>
<p>Non solicitæ possunt curæ,</p>
<p>Mutare rati stamina fusi;</p>
<p>Quicquid patimur mortale genus,</p>
<p>Quicquid facimus venit ex alto;</p>
<p>Servatque sua decreta colus,</p>
<p>Lachesis dura revoluta manu.</p>
</div>

<p>Some degree of poetical justice might have been preserved, and
a valuable moral inculcated, had the conduct of &OElig;dipus, in his
combat with Laius, been represented as atrocious, or, at least, unwarrantable;
as the sequel would then have been a warning, how
impossible it is to calculate the consequences or extent of a single
act of guilt. But, after all, Dryden perhaps extracts the true
moral, while stating our insufficiency to estimate the distribution
of good and evil in human life, in a passage, which, in excellent
poetry, expresses more sound truth, than a whole shelf of philosophers:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>The Gods are just&mdash;</p>
<p>But how can finite measure infinite?</p>
<p>Reason! alas, it does not know itself!</p>
<p>Yet man, vain man, would, with this, short-lined plummet,</p>
<p>Fathom the vast abyss of heavenly justice.</p>
<p>Whatever is, is in its causes just,</p>
<p>Since all things are by fate. But purblind man</p>
<p>Sees but a part o'the chain; the nearest links;</p>
<p>His eyes not carrying to that equal beam,</p>
<p>That poises all above.&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>The prologue states, that the play, if damned, may be recorded
as the "first buried since the Woollen Act." This enables us to
fix the date of the performance. By the 30th Charles II. cap.
3. all persons were appointed to be buried in woollen after 1st
August, 1678. The play must therefore have been represented
early in the season 1678-9. It was not printed until 1679.</p>

<h3 class="chap">PREFACE.</h3>

<p>Though it be dangerous to raise too great an expectation,
especially in works of this nature, where
we are to please an insatiable audience, yet it is
reasonable to prepossess them in favour of an author;
and therefore, both the prologue and epilogue informed
you, that &OElig;dipus was the most celebrated
piece of all antiquity; that Sophocles, not only the
greatest wit, but one of the greatest men in Athens,
made it for the stage at the public cost; and that it
had the reputation of being his masterpiece, not
only among the seven of his which are still remaining,
but of the greater number which are perished.
Aristotle has more than once admired it, in his Book
of Poetry; Horace has mentioned it: Lucullus, Julius
Cæsar, and other noble Romans, have written on
the same subject, though their poems are wholly
lost; but Seneca's is still preserved. In our own
age, Corneille has attempted it, and, it appears by
his preface, with great success. But a judicious
reader will easily observe, how much the copy is
inferior to the original. He tells you himself, that
he owes a great part of his success, to the happy
episode of Theseus and Dirce; which is the same
thing, as if we should acknowledge, that we were
<span class="pgnm">125</span><a id="page_125" name="page_125"></a>
indebted for our good fortune to the under-plot of
Adrastus, Eurydice, and Creon. The truth is, he
miserably failed in the character of his hero: If he
desired that &OElig;dipus should be pitied, he should
have made him a better man. He forgot, that Sophocles
had taken care to show him, in his first entrance,
a just, a merciful, a successful, a religious
prince, and, in short, a father of his country. Instead
of these, he has drawn him suspicious, designing,
more anxious of keeping the Theban crown,
than solicitous for the safety of his people; hectored
by Theseus, condemned by Dirce, and scarce maintaining
a second part in his own tragedy. This was
an error in the first concoction; and therefore never
to be mended in the second or the third. He introduced
a greater hero than &OElig;dipus himself; for when
Theseus was once there, that companion of Hercules
must yield to none. The poet was obliged to
furnish him with business, to make him an equipage
suitable to his dignity; and, by following him too
close, to lose his other king of Brentford in the
crowd. Seneca, on the other side, as if there were
no such thing as nature to be minded in a play, is
always running after pompous expression, pointed
sentences, and philosophical notions, more proper for
the study than the stage: the Frenchman followed
a wrong scent; and the Roman was absolutely at
cold hunting. All we could gather out of Corneille
was, that an episode must be, but not his way:
and Seneca supplied us with no new hint, but only
a relation which he makes of his Tiresias raising the
ghost of Laius; which is here performed in view of
the audience,&mdash;the rites and ceremonies, so far his, as
he agreed with antiquity, and the religion of the
Greeks. But he himself was beholden to Homer's
Tiresias, in the "Odysses," for some of them; and the
rest have been collected from Heliodore's "Ethiopiques,"
<span class="pgnm">126</span><a id="page_126" name="page_126"></a>
and Lucan's Erictho<a class="ftnt" href="#OEdip_2-1">[1]</a>. Sophocles, indeed,
is admirable everywhere; and therefore we have
followed him as close as possibly we could. But
the Athenian theatre, (whether more perfect than
ours, is not now disputed,) had a perfection differing
from ours. You see there in every act a single
scene, (or two at most,) which manage the business
of the play; and after that succeeds the chorus,
which commonly takes up more time in singing,
than there has been employed in speaking. The
principal person appears almost constantly through
the play; but the inferior parts seldom above once
in the whole tragedy. The conduct of our stage is
much more difficult, where we are obliged never to
lose any considerable character, which we have once
presented. Custom likewise has obtained, that we
must form an under-plot of second persons, which
must be depending on the first; and their by-walks
must be like those in a labyrinth, which all of them
lead into the great parterre; or like so many several
lodging chambers, which have their outlets into
the same gallery. Perhaps, after all, if we could
think so, the ancient method, as it is the easiest, is
also the most natural, and the best. For variety,
as it is managed, is too often subject to breed distraction;
and while we would please too many
<span class="pgnm">127</span><a id="page_127" name="page_127"></a>
ways, for want of art in the conduct, we please in
none<a class="ftnt" href="#OEdip_2-2">[2]</a>. But we have given you more already than
was necessary for a preface; and, for aught we know,
may gain no more by our instructions, than that
politic nation is like to do, who have taught their
enemies to fight so long, that at last they are in a
condition to invade them<a class="ftnt" href="#OEdip_2-3">[3]</a>.</p>

<h3 class="chap">PROLOGUE.</h3>

<div class="poem">
<p>When Athens all the Grecian slate did guide,</p>
<p>And Greece gave laws to all the world beside;</p>
<p>Then Sophocles with Socrates did sit,</p>
<p>Supreme in wisdom one, and one in wit:</p>
<p>And wit from wisdom differed not in those,</p>
<p>But as 'twas sung in verse, or said in prose.</p>
<p>Then, &OElig;dipus, on crowded theatres,</p>
<p>Drew all admiring eyes and list'ning ears:</p>
<p>The pleased spectator shouted every line,</p>
<p>The noblest, manliest, and the best design!</p>
<p>And every critic of each learned age,</p>
<p>By this just model has reformed the stage.</p>
<p>Now, should it fail, (as heaven avert our fear!)</p>
<p>Damn it in silence, lest the world should hear.</p>
<p>For were it known this poem did not please,</p>
<p>You might set up for perfect savages:</p>
<p>Your neighbours would not look on you as men,</p>
<p>But think the nation all turned Picts again.</p>
<p>Faith, as you manage matters, 'tis not fit</p>
<p>You should suspect yourselves of too much wit:</p>
<p>Drive not the jest too far, but spare this piece;</p>
<p>And, for this once, be not more wise than Greece.</p>
<p>See twice! do not pell-mell to damning fall,</p>
<p>Like true-born Britons, who ne'er think at all:</p>
<p>Pray be advised; and though at Mons<a class="ftnt" href="#OEdip_3-1">[1]</a> you won,</p>
<p>On pointed cannon do not always run.</p>
<p><span class="pgnm">129</span><a id="page_129" name="page_129"></a>
With some respect to ancient wit proceed;</p>
<p>You take the four first councils for your creed.</p>
<p>But, when you lay tradition wholly by,</p>
<p>And on the private spirit alone rely,</p>
<p>You turn fanatics in your poetry.</p>
<p>If, notwithstanding all that we can say,</p>
<p>You needs will have your penn'orths of the play,</p>
<p>And come resolved to damn, because you pay,</p>
<p>Record it, in memorial of the fact,</p>
<p>The first play buried since the woollen act.</p>

<p>Footnote:</p>
<ol>
<li><a id="OEdip_3-1" name="OEdip_3-1"></a>On the 17th of August, 1678, the Prince of Orange, afterwards William
III. marched to the attack of the French army, which blockaded Mons, and
lay secured by the most formidable entrenchments. Notwithstanding a
powerful and well-served artillery, the duke of Luxemburgh was forced to
abandon his trenches, and retire with great loss. The English and Scottish
regiments, under the gallant earl of Ossory, had their full share in the glory
of the day. It is strongly suspected, that the Prince of Orange, when he undertook
this perilous atchievement, knew that a peace had been signed betwixt
France and the States, though the intelligence was not made public till
next day. Carleton says, that the troops, when drawn up for the attack, supposed
the purpose was to fire a <i>feu-de-joie</i> for the conclusion of the war. The
enterprize, therefore, though successful, was needless as well as desperate,
and merited Dryden's oblique censure.</li>

<p>This diffuse account of the different kinds of forest trees, which
composed the enchanted grove, is very inartificially put into
the mouth of Creon, who, notwithstanding the horrible message
which he has to deliver to &OElig;dipus from the ghost, finds time to
solace the king with this long description of a place, which he
doubtless knew as well as Creon himself. Dryden, on the contrary,
has, with great address, rendered the description necessary,
by the violence committed within the sacred precinct, and
turned it, not upon minute and rhetorical detail, but upon the general
awful properties of this consecrated ground. Lucan's fine description
of the Massyllian forest, and that of the enchanted grove

<div class="poem">
<p>What Sophocles could undertake alone,</p>
<p>Our poets found a work for more than one;</p>
<p>And therefore two lay tugging at the piece,</p>
<p>With all their force, to draw the ponderous mass from Greece;</p>
<p>A weight that bent even Seneca's strong muse,</p>
<p>And which Corneille's shoulders did refuse.</p>
<p>So hard it is the Athenian harp to string!</p>
<p>So much two consuls yield to one just king.</p>
<p>Terror and pity this whole poem sway;</p>
<p>The mightiest machines that can mount a play.</p>
<p>How heavy will those vulgar souls be found,</p>
<p>Whom two such engines cannot move from ground!</p>
<p>When Greece and Rome have smiled upon this birth,</p>
<p>You can but damn for one poor spot of earth;</p>
<p>And when your children find your judgment such,</p>
<p>They'll scorn their sires, and wish themselves born Dutch;</p>
<p>Each haughty poet will infer with ease,</p>
<p>How much his wit must under-write to please.</p>
<p>As some strong churl would, brandishing, advance</p>
<p>The monumental sword that conquered France;</p>
<p>So you, by judging this, your judgment teach,</p>
<p>Thus far you like, that is, thus far you reach.</p>
<p>Since then the vote of full two thousand years</p>
<p>Has crowned this plot, and all the dead are theirs,</p>
<p>Think it a debt you pay, not alms you give,</p>
<p>And, in your own defence, let this play live.</p>

the courtiers and opposition, in the latter part of Charles the II. reign,
these anti-papal solemnities were conducted by the latter, with great
state and expence, and employed as engines to excite the popular resentment
against the duke of York, and his religion. The following curious

<p>"On the said 17th of November, 1679, the bells, generally, about the
town, began to ring at three o'clock in the morning. At the approach of
the evening, (all things being in readiness) the solemn procession began,
setting forth from Moregate, and so passed, first to Aldgate, and thence
through Leadenhall-street, by the Royal Exchange, through Cheapside,
and so to Temple-bar in the ensuing order, viz.</p>

<ol>
<li>"Came six whifflers, to clear the way, in pioneer caps, and red
waistcoats.</li>

<li>"A bellman ringing, and with a loud (but doleful) voice, crying out
all the way, remember Justice Godfrey.</li>

<li>"A dead body, representing justice Godfrey, in a decent black habit,
carried before a jesuit, in black, on horse-back, in like manner as he
was carried by the assassins to Primrose Hill.</li>

<li>"Next after Sir Edmonbury, so mounted, came a priest in a surplice,
with a cope embroidered with dead bones, skeletons, skulls, and
the like, giving pardons very plentifully to all those who should murder
protestants; and proclaiming it meritorious.</li>

<li>"Then a priest in black alone, with a great silver cross.</li>

<li>"Four carmelites, in white and black habits.</li>

<li>"Four grey-friars, in the proper habits of their order.</li>

<li>"Six jesuits, with bloody daggers.</li>

<li>"A concert of wind music.</li>

<li>"Four bishops, in purple, and lawn sleeves, with a golden crosier
on their breast, and crosier-staves in their hands.</li>

<li>"Four other bishops, in <i>Pontificalibus</i>, with surplices, and rich
embroidered copes, and golden mitres on their heads.</li>

<li>"Six cardinals, in scarlet robes and caps.</li>

<li>"The Pope's doctor, <i>i.e.</i> Wakeman,<a class="ftnt" href="#OEdip_5-1a">[a]</a> with jesuits-powder in one
hand, and an urinal in the other.</li>

<li>"Two priests in surplices, with two golden crosses.</li>
</ol>

<p>"Lastly, The Pope, in a lofty, glorious pageant, representing a chair of
state, covered with scarlet, richly embroidered and fringed, and bedecked
with golden balls and crosses: At his feet a cushion of state, and two
boys in surplices with white silk banners, and bloody crucifixes and daggers
with an incense pot before them, censing his holiness, who was arrayed
in a splendid scarlet gown, lined through with ermin, and richly
daubed with gold and silver lace; on his head a triple crown of gold,
and a glorious collar of gold and precious stones, St Peter's keys, a number
of beads, agnus deis, and other catholic trumpery. At his back, his
holiness's privy counsellor, the degraded Seraphim, (<i>anglice</i> the devil,)
frequently caressing, hugging, and whispering him, and oft times instructing
him aloud to destroy his majesty, to forge a protestant plot, and to fire
the city again, to which purpose he held an infernal torch in his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pgnm">224</span><a id="page_224" name="page_224"></a>
"The whole procession was attended with 150 flambeaux and lights, by
order; but so many more came in volunteers, as made up some thousands.</p>

<p>"Never were the balconies, windows, and houses more numerously
lined, or the streets closer throng'd with multitudes of people, all expressing
their abhorrence of Popery, with continual shouts and exclamations;
so that 'tis modestly computed, that, in the whole progress, there
could not be fewer than two hundred thousand spectators.</p>

<p>"Thus with a slow, and solemn state, they proceeded to Temple Bar;
where with innumerable swarms, the houses seemed to be converted
into heaps of men, and women, and children, for whose diversion there
were provided great variety of excellent fireworks.</p>

<p>"Temple Bar being, since its rebuilding, adorned with four stately
statues, viz. those of Queen Elizabeth and King James, on the inward,
or eastern side, fronting the city; and those of King Charles the I. of
blessed memory, and our present gracious sovereign, (whom God, in
mercy to these nations, long preserve!) on the outside, facing towards
Westminster; and the statue of Queen Elizabeth in regard to the day,
having on a crown of gilded laurel, and in her hand a golden shield,
with this motto inscribed: <i>The Protestant Religion, and Magna Charta</i>,
and flambeaux placed before it. The Pope being brought up near thereunto,
the following song, alluding to the posture of those statues, was
sung in parts, between one representing the English Cardinal (<i>Howard</i>)<a class="ftnt" href="#OEdip_5-1b">[b]</a>
and others acting the people:</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>"Then having entertained the thronging spectators for some time,
with the ingenious fireworks, a vast bonfire being prepared, just over
against the inner temple gate, his holiness, after some compliments and
reluctancies, was decently toppled from all his grandeur, into the impartial
flames; the crafty devil leaving his infallibilityship in the lurch,
and laughing as heartily at his deserved ignominious end, as subtle jesuits
do at the ruin of bigotted Lay Catholics, whom themselves have
drawn in; or, as credulous Coleman's abettors did, when, with pretences
of a reprieve at last gasp, they had made him vomit up his soul with
a lye, and sealed his dangerous chops with a halter. This justice was attended
with a prodigious shout, that might be heard far beyond Somerset-house;
and 'twas believed the echo, by continued reverberations, before
it ceased, reached <i>Scotland</i>, (the Duke was then there;) France,
and even Rome, itself, damping them all with a dreadfull astonishment."</p>

<h3 class="chap">TROILUS AND CRESSIDA.</h3>

<p>The story of Troilus and Cressida was one of the more modern
fables, engrafted, during the dark ages, on "the tale of Troy divine."
Chaucer, who made it the subject of a long and somewhat dull
poem, professes to have derived his facts from an author of the
middle ages, called Lollius, to whom he often refers, and who he
states to have written in Latin. Tyrwhitt disputes the existence
of this personage, and supposes Chaucer's original to have been the
<i>Philostrato dell' amorose fatiche de Troilo,</i> a work of Boccacio.
But Chaucer was never reluctant in acknowledging obligations to
his contemporaries, when such really existed; and Mr Tyrwhitt's
opinion seems to be successfully combated by Mr Godwin, in his
"Life of Chaucer." The subject, whencesoever derived, was
deemed by Shakespeare worthy of the stage; and his tragedy,
of Troilus and Cressida, contains so many scenes of distinguished
excellence, that it could have been wished our author had mentioned
it with more veneration. In truth, even the partiality of an
editor must admit, that on this occasion, the modern improvements
of Dryden shew to very little advantage beside the venerable structure
to which they have been attached. The arrangement of the
plot is, indeed, more artificially modelled; but the preceding age,
during which the infidelity of Cressida was proverbially current,
could as little have endured a catastrophe turning upon the discovery
of her innocence, as one which should have exhibited Helen
chaste, or Hector a coward. In Dryden's time, the prejudice
against this unfortunate female was probably forgotten, as her
history had become less popular. There appears, however, something
too nice and fastidious in the critical rule, which exacts that
the hero and heroine of the drama shall be models of virtuous perfection.
In the most interesting of the ancient plays we find this
limitation neglected, with great success; and it would have been
more natural to have brought about the catastrophe on the plan
of Shakespeare and Chaucer, than by the forced mistake in which
Dryden's lovers are involved, and the stale expedient of Cressida's
killing herself, to evince her innocence. For the superior order,
and regard to the unity of place, with which Dryden has new-modelled
the scenes and entries, he must be allowed the full praise
which he claims in the preface.</p>

<p><span class="pgnm">229</span><a id="page_229" name="page_229"></a>
In the dialogue, considered as distinct from the plot, Dryden
appears not to have availed himself fully of the treasures of his
predecessor. He has pitilessly retrenched the whole scene, in
the 3d act, between Ulysses and Achilles, full of the purest and
most admirable moral precept, expressed in the most poetical and
dignified language<a class="ftnt" href="#Troil_1-1">[1]</a>. Probably this omission arose from Dryden's
desire to simplify the plot, by leaving out the intrigues of the Grecian
chiefs, and limiting the interest to the amours of Troilus and
<span class="pgnm">230</span><a id="page_230" name="page_230"></a>
Cressida. But he could not be insensible to the merit of this
scene, though he has supplied it by one far inferior, in which
Ulysses is introduced, using gross flattery to the buffoon Thersites.
In the latter part of the play, Dryden has successfully exerted
his own inventive powers. The quarrelling scene between
Hector and Troilus is very impressive, and no bad imitation
of that betwixt Brutus and Cassius, with which Dryden seems
to have been so much charmed, and which he has repeatedly
striven to emulate. The parting of Hector and Andromache contains
some affecting passages, some of which may be traced back
to Homer; although the pathos, upon the whole, is far inferior to
that of the noted scene in the Iliad, and destitute of the noble simplicity
of the Grecian bard.</p>

<p>Mr Godwin has justly remarked, that the delicacy of Chaucer's
ancient tale has suffered even in the hands of Shakespeare; but in
those of Dryden it has undergone a far deeper deterioration.
Whatever is coarse and naked in Shakespeare, has been dilated into
ribaldry by the poet laureat of Charles the second; and the character
of Pandarus, in particular, is so grossly heightened, as to
disgrace even the obliging class to whom that unfortunate procurer
has bequeathed his name. So far as this play is to be considered
as an alteration of Shakespeare, I fear it must be allowed, that our
author has suppressed some of his finest poetry, and exaggerated
some of his worst faults.</p>

<p>Troilus and Cressida was published in 1679.</p>

EARL OF SUNDERLAND<a class="ftnt" href="#Troil_2-1">[1]</a>,<br />
PRINCIPAL SECRETARY OF STATE,<br />
ONE OF HIS MAJESTY'S
MOST HONOURABLE PRIVY-COUNCIL, &amp;C.</h3>

<p class="noind smcap">My Lord,</p>

<p>Since I cannot promise you much of poetry in my
play, it is but reasonable that I should secure you
from any part of it in my dedication. And indeed
I cannot better distinguish the exactness of your
taste from that of other men, than by the plainness
and sincerity of my address. I must keep my
hyperboles in reserve for men of other understandings.
<span class="pgnm">232</span><a id="page_232" name="page_232"></a>
An hungry appetite after praise, and a strong
digestion of it, will bear the grossness of that diet;
but one of so critical a judgment as your lordship,
who can set the bounds of just and proper in every
subject, would give me small encouragement for so
bold an undertaking. I more than suspect, my
lord, that you would not do common justice to
yourself; and, therefore, were I to give that character
of you, which I think you truly merit, I
would make my appeal from your lordship to the
reader, and would justify myself from flattery by
the public voice, whatever protestation you might
enter to the contrary. But I find I am to take
other measures with your lordship; I am to stand
upon my guard with you, and to approach you as
warily as Horace did Augustus:</p>

<div class="poem pi">
<p>Cui malè si palpere, recalcitrat undique tutus.</p>
</div>

<p class="noind">An ill-timed, or an extravagant commendation,
would not pass upon you; but you would keep off
such a dedicator at arms-end, and send him back
with his encomiums to this lord, or that lady, who
stood in need of such trifling merchandise. You
see, my lord, what an awe you have upon me, when
I dare not offer you that incense which would be
acceptable to other patrons; but am forced to
curb myself from ascribing to you those honours,
which even an enemy could not deny you. Yet I
must confess, I never practised that virtue of moderation
(which is properly your character) with so
much reluctancy as now: for it hinders me from
being true to my own knowledge, in not witnessing
your worth, and deprives me of the only means
which I had left, to shew the world that true honour
and uninterested respect which I have always
paid you. I would say somewhat, if it were possible
which might distinguish that veneration I have
<span class="pgnm">233</span><a id="page_233" name="page_233"></a>
for you, from the flatteries of those who adore your
fortune. But the eminence of your condition, in
this particular, is my unhappiness; for it renders
whatever I would say suspected. Professions of
service, submissions, and attendance, are the practice
of all men to the great; and commonly they,
who have the least sincerity, perform them best; as
they, who are least engaged in love, have their
tongues the freest to counterfeit a passion. For my
own part, I never could shake off the rustic bashfulness
which hangs upon my nature; but, valuing
myself at as little as I am worth, have been afraid
to render even the common duties of respect to
those who are in power. The ceremonious visits,
which are generally paid on such occasions, are not
my talent. They may be real even in courtiers, but
they appear with such a face of interest, that a modest
man would think himself in danger of having
his sincerity mistaken for his design. My congratulations
keep their distance, and pass no farther
than my heart. There it is that I have all the joy
imaginable, when I see true worth rewarded, and
virtue uppermost in the world.</p>

<p>If, therefore, there were one to whom I had the
honour to be known; and to know him so perfectly,
that I could say, without flattery, he had all the
depth of understanding that was requisite in an able
statesman, and all that honesty which commonly is
wanting; that he was brave without vanity, and
knowing without positiveness; that he was loyal
to his prince, and a lover of his country; that his
principles were full of moderation, and all his counsels
such as tended to heal, and not to widen, the
breaches of the nation: that in all his conversation
there appeared a native candour, and a desire of doing
good in all his actions: if such an one, whom I
have described, were at the helm; if he had risen
<span class="pgnm">234</span><a id="page_234" name="page_234"></a>
by his merits, and were chosen out in the necessity
and pressures of affairs, to remedy our confusions
by the seasonableness of his advice, and to put a stop
to our ruin, when we were just rolling downward
to the precipice; I should then congratulate the age
in which I live, for the common safety; I should
not despair of the republic, though Hannibal were
at the gates; I should send up my vows for the
success of such an action, as Virgil did, on the like
occasion, for his patron, when he was raising up his
country from the desolations of a civil war:</p>

<div class="poem pi">
<p>Hunc saltem everso juvenem succurrere seclo</p>
<p>Ne, superi, prohibete.</p>
</div>

<p>I know not whither I am running, in this extacy
which is now upon me: I am almost ready to re-assume
the ancient rights of poetry; to point out, and
prophecy the man, who was born for no less an undertaking,
and whom posterity shall bless for its
accomplishment. Methinks, I am already taking
fire from such a character, and making room for him,
under a borrowed name, amongst the heroes of an
epic poem. Neither could mine, or some more happy
genius, want encouragement under such a patron:</p>

<div class="poem pi">
<p>Pollio amat nostram, quamvis sit rustica, musam.</p>
</div>

<p>But these are considerations afar off, my lord:
the former part of the prophecy must be first accomplished;
the quiet of the nation must be secured;
and a mutual trust, betwixt prince and people, be
renewed; and then this great and good man will
have leisure for the ornaments of peace; and make
our language as much indebted to his care, as the
French is to the memory of their famous Richelieu<a class="ftnt" href="#Troil_2-2">[2]</a>.
<span class="pgnm">235</span><a id="page_235" name="page_235"></a>
You know, my lord, how low he laid the foundations
of so great a work; that he began it with a
grammar and a dictionary; without which all those
remarks and observations, which have since been
made, had been performed to as little purpose, as it
would be to consider the furniture of the rooms,
before the contrivance of the house. Propriety
must first be stated, ere any measures of elegance
can be taken. Neither is one Vaugelas sufficient
for such a work<a class="ftnt" href="#Troil_2-3">[3]</a>. It was the employment of the
whole academy for many years; for the perfect
knowledge of a tongue was never attained by any
single person. The court, the college, and the
town, must be joined in it. And as our English
is a composition of the dead and living tongues,
there is required a perfect knowledge, not only of the
Greek and Latin, but of the old German, the French,
and the Italian; and, to help all these, a conversation
with those authors of our own, who have
written with the fewest faults in prose and verse.
But how barbarously we yet write and speak, your
lordship knows, and I am sufficiently sensible in my
own English. For I am often put to a stand, in
considering whether what I write be the idiom of
the tongue, or false grammar, and nonsense couched
beneath that specious name of Anglicism; and
have no other way to clear my doubts, but by
translating my English into Latin, and thereby
trying what sense the words will bear in a more
stable language. I am desirous, if it were possible,
that we might all write with the same certainty of
words, and purity of phrase, to which the Italians
first arrived, and after them the French; at least
that we might advance so far, as our tongue is capable
of such a standard. It would mortify an
<span class="pgnm">236</span><a id="page_236" name="page_236"></a>
Englishman to consider, that from the time of
Boccace and of Petrarch, the Italian has varied
very little; and that the English of Chaucer, their
contemporary, is not to be understood without the
help of an old dictionary. But their Goth and
Vandal had the fortune to be grafted on a Roman
stock; ours has the disadvantage to be founded on
the Dutch<a class="ftnt" href="#Troil_2-4">[4]</a>. We are full of monosyllables, and those
clogged with consonants, and our pronunciation is
effeminate; all which are enemies to a sounding
language. It is true, that to supply our poverty,
we have trafficked with our neighbour nations; by
which means we abound as much in words, as Amsterdam
does in religions; but to order them, and
make them useful after their admission, is the difficulty.
A greater progress has been made in this,
since his majesty's return, than, perhaps, since the
conquest to his time. But the better part of the
work remains unfinished; and that which has been
done already, since it has only been in the practice
of some few writers, must be digested into rules
and method, before it can be profitable to the general.
Will your lordship give me leave to speak
out at last? and to acquaint the world, that from
your encouragement and patronage, we may one
day expect to speak and write a language, worthy
of the English wit, and which foreigners may not
disdain to learn? Your birth, your education, your
natural endowments, the former employments which
you have had abroad, and that which, to the joy of
good men you now exercise at home, seem all to
conspire to this design: the genius of the nation
seems to call you out as it were by name, to polish
and adorn your native language, and to take from
it the reproach of its barbarity. It is upon this
<span class="pgnm">237</span><a id="page_237" name="page_237"></a>
encouragement that I have adventured on the following
critique, which I humbly present you, together
with the play; in which, though I have
not had the leisure, nor indeed the encouragement,
to proceed to the principal subject of it, which is
the words and thoughts that are suitable to tragedy;
yet the whole discourse has a tendency that way,
and is preliminary to it. In what I have already
done, I doubt not but I have contradicted some of
my former opinions, in my loose essays of the like
nature; but of this, I dare affirm, that it is the
fruit of my riper age and experience, and that self-love,
or envy have no part in it. The application
to English authors is my own, and therein, perhaps,
I may have erred unknowingly; but the foundation
of the rules is reason, and the authority of
those living critics who have had the honour to be
known to you abroad, as well as of the ancients,
who are not less of your acquaintance. Whatsoever
it be, I submit it to your lordship's judgment,
from which I never will appeal, unless it be to your
good nature, and your candour. If you can allow
an hour of leisure to the perusal of it, I shall be
fortunate that I could so long entertain you; if
not, I shall at least have the satisfaction to know,
that your time was more usefully employed upon
the public. I am,</p>

<h3 class="chap">THE
PREFACE.</h3>

<p>The poet &AElig;schylus was held in the same veneration
by the Athenians of after-ages, as Shakespeare
is by us; and Longinus has judged, in favour of
him, that he had a noble boldness of expression,
and that his imaginations were lofty and heroic;
but, on the other side, Quintilian affirms, that he
was daring to extravagance. It is certain, that he
affected pompous words, and that his sense was obscured
by figures; notwithstanding these imperfections,
the value of his writings after his decease was
such, that his countrymen ordained an equal reward
to those poets, who could alter his plays to be
acted on the theatre, with those whose productions
were wholly new, and of their own. The case is
not the same in England; though the difficulties
of altering are greater, and our reverence for Shakespeare
much more just, than that of the Grecians
for &AElig;schylus. In the age of that poet, the Greek
tongue was arrived to its full perfection; they had
<span class="pgnm">239</span><a id="page_239" name="page_239"></a>
then amongst them an exact standard of writing
and of speaking: the English language is not capable
of such a certainty; and we are at present so
far from it, that we are wanting in the very foundation
of it, a perfect grammar. Yet it must be
allowed to the present age, that the tongue in general
is so much refined since Shakespeare's time,
that many of his words, and more of his phrases,
are scarce intelligible. And of those which we understand,
some are ungrammatical, others coarse;
and his whole style is so pestered with figurative
expressions, that it is as affected as it is obscure.
It is true, that in his latter plays he had worn off
somewhat of the rust; but the tragedy, which I
have undertaken to correct, was in all probability
one of his first endeavours on the stage.</p>

<p>The original story was written by one Lollius a
Lombard, in Latin verse, and translated by Chaucer
into English; intended, I suppose, a satire on
the inconstancy of women: I find nothing of it
among the ancients; not so much as the name
Cressida once mentioned. Shakespeare, (as I hinted)
in the apprenticeship of his writing, modelled
it into that play, which is now called by the name
of "Troilus and Cressida," but so lamely is it left
to us, that it is not divided into acts; which fault
I ascribe to the actors who printed it after Shakespeare's
death; and that too so carelessly, that a
more uncorrected copy I never saw. For the play
itself, the author seems to have begun it with some
fire; the characters of Pandarus and Thersites, are
promising enough; but as if he grew weary of his
task, after an entrance or two, he lets them fall:
and the latter part of the tragedy is nothing but a
confusion of drums and trumpets, excursions and
alarms. The chief persons, who give name to the
tragedy, are left alive; Cressida is false, and is not
<span class="pgnm">240</span><a id="page_240" name="page_240"></a>
punished. Yet, after all, because the play was
Shakespeare's, and that there appeared in some
places of it the admirable genius of the author, I
undertook to remove that heap of rubbish under
which many excellent thoughts lay wholly buried.
Accordingly, I new modelled the plot, threw out
many unnecessary persons, improved those characters
which were begun and left unfinished, as Hector,
Troilus, Pandarus, and Thersites, and added that of
Andromache. After this, I made, with no small
trouble, an order and connection of all the scenes;
removing them from the places where they were inartificially
set; and, though it was impossible to
keep them all unbroken, because the scene must be
sometimes in the city and sometimes in the camp,
yet I have so ordered them, that there is a coherence
of them with one another, and a dependence
on the main design; no leaping from Troy to the
Grecian tents, and thence back again, in the same
act, but a due proportion of time allowed for every
motion. I need not say that I have refined his
language, which before was obsolete; but I am willing
to acknowledge, that as I have often drawn his
English nearer to our times, so I have sometimes
conformed my own to his; and consequently, the
language is not altogether so pure as it is significant.
The scenes of Pandarus and Cressida, of
Troilus and Pandarus, of Andromache with Hector
and the Trojans, in the second act, are wholly new;
together with that of Nestor and Ulysses with
Thersites, and that of Thersites with Ajax and
Achilles.  I will not weary my reader with the
scenes which are added of Pandarus and the lovers,
in the third, and those of Thersites, which are
wholly altered; but I cannot omit the last scene in
it, which is almost half the act, betwixt Troilus and
Hector. The occasion of raising it was hinted to
<span class="pgnm">241</span><a id="page_241" name="page_241"></a>
me by Mr Betterton; the contrivance and working
of it was my own. They who think to do me an
injury, by saying, that it is an imitation of the
scene betwixt Brutus and Cassius, do me an honour,
by supposing I could imitate the incomparable
Shakespeare; but let me add, that if Shakespeare's
scene, or that faulty copy of it in "Amintor
and Melantius," had never been, yet Euripides
had furnished me with an excellent example in his
"Iphigenia," between Agamemnon and Menelaus;
and from thence, indeed, the last turn of it is borrowed.
The occasion which Shakespeare, Euripides, and
Fletcher, have all taken, is the same,&mdash;grounded upon
friendship; and the quarrel of two virtuous men,
raised by natural degrees to the extremity of passion,
is conducted in all three, to the declination
of the same passion, and concludes with a warm
renewing of their friendship. But the particular
ground-work which Shakespeare has taken, is incomparably
the best; because he has not only chosen
two of the greatest heroes of their age, but has
likewise interested the liberty of Rome, and their
own honours, who were the redeemers of it, in this
debate. And if he has made Brutus, who was naturally
a patient man, to fly into excess at first, let
it be remembered in his defence, that, just before,
he has received the news of Portia's death; whom
the poet, on purpose neglecting a little chronology,
supposes to have died before Brutus, only to give
him an occasion of being more easily exasperated.
Add to this, that the injury he had received from
Cassius, had long been brooding in his mind; and
that a melancholy man, upon consideration of an
affront, especially from a friend, would be more eager
in his passion, than he who had given it, though
naturally more choleric. Euripides, whom I have
followed, has raised the quarrel betwixt two brothers,
<span class="pgnm">242</span><a id="page_242" name="page_242"></a>
who were friends. The foundation of the scene
was this: The Grecians were wind-bound at the port
of Aulis, and the oracle had said, that they could not
sail, unless Agamemnon delivered up his daughter
to be sacrificed: he refuses; his brother Menelaus
urges the public safety; the father defends himself
by arguments of natural affection, and hereupon
they quarrel. Agamemnon is at last convinced,
and promises to deliver up Iphigenia, but so passionately
laments his loss, that Menelaus is grieved
to have been the occasion of it, and, by a return of
kindness, offers to intercede for him with the Grecians,
that his daughter might not be sacrificed.
But my friend Mr Rymer has so largely, and with
so much judgment, described this scene, in comparing
it with that of Melantius and Amintor, that
it is superfluous to say more of it; I only named
the heads of it, that any reasonable man might
judge it was from thence I modelled my scene betwixt
Troilus and Hector. I will conclude my reflections
on it, with a passage of Longinus, concerning
Plato's imitation of Homer: "We ought
not to regard a good imitation as a theft, but as a
beautiful idea of him who undertakes to imitate,
by forming himself on the invention and the work
of another man; for he enters into the lists like a
new wrestler, to dispute the prize with the former
champion. This sort of emulation, says Hesiod, is
honourable, <span class="Greek" title="Agath&ecirc; d' eris esti Brotoisin">
&Alpha;&gamma;&alpha;&theta;&eta;
&delta;&rsquo;
&epsilon;&rho;&iota;&sigmaf;
&epsilon;&sigma;&tau;&iota;
&Beta;&rho;&omicron;&tau;&omicron;&iota;&sigma;&iota;&nu;</span>&mdash;when we combat
for victory with a hero, and are not without
glory even in our overthrow. Those great men,
whom we propose to ourselves as patterns of our
imitation, serve us as a torch, which is lifted up before
us, to enlighten our passage, and often elevate
our thoughts as high as the conception we have of
our author's genius."</p>

<p>I have been so tedious in three acts, that I shall
<span class="pgnm">243</span><a id="page_243" name="page_243"></a>
contract myself in the two last. The beginning
scenes of the fourth act are either added or changed
wholly by me; the middle of it is Shakespeare altered,
and mingled with my own; three or four of
the last scenes are altogether new. And the whole
fifth act, both the plot and the writing, are my own
additions.</p>

<p>But having written so much for imitation of what
is excellent, in that part of the preface which related
only to myself, methinks it would neither be
unprofitable nor unpleasant to inquire how far we
ought to imitate our own poets, Shakespeare and
Fletcher, in their tragedies; and this will occasion
another inquiry, how those two writers differ between
themselves: but since neither of these questions
can be solved, unless some measures be first
taken, by which we may be enabled to judge truly
of their writings, I shall endeavour, as briefly as I
can, to discover the grounds and reason of all criticism,
applying them in this place only to Tragedy.
Aristotle with his interpreters, and Horace, and
Longinus, are the authors to whom I owe my lights;
and what part soever of my own plays, or of this,
which no mending could make regular, shall fall
under the condemnation of such judges, it would
be impudence in me to defend. I think it no shame
to retract my errors, and am well pleased to suffer
in the cause, if the art may be improved at my expence:
I therefore proceed to</p>

<p class="ctr">THE GROUNDS OF CRITICISM IN TRAGEDY.</p>

<p>Tragedy is thus defined by Aristotle (omitting
what I thought unnecessary in his definition). It
is an imitation of one entire, great, and probable
action; not told, but represented; which, by moving
<span class="pgnm">244</span><a id="page_244" name="page_244"></a>
in us fear and pity, is conducive to the purging
of those two passions in our minds. More largely
thus: Tragedy describes or paints an action, which
action must have all the properties above named.
First, it must be one or single; that is, it must not
be a history of one man's life, suppose of Alexander
the Great, or Julius Cæsar, but one single action
of theirs. This condemns all Shakespeare's historical
plays, which are rather chronicles represented,
than tragedies; and all double action of plays. As,
to avoid a satire upon others, I will make bold with
my own "Marriage A-la-mode," where there are
manifestly two actions, not depending on one another;
but in "&OElig;dipus" there cannot properly be
said to be two actions, because the love of Adrastus
and Eurydice has a necessary dependence on
the principal design into which it is woven. The
natural reason of this rule is plain; for two different
independent actions distract the attention and
concernment of the audience, and consequently
destroy the intention of the poet; if his business
be to move terror and pity, and one of his actions
he comical, the other tragical, the former will divert
the people, and utterly make void his greater
purpose. Therefore, as in perspective, so in tragedy,
there must be a point of sight in which all
the lines terminate; otherwise the eye wanders, and
the work is false. This was the practice of the Grecian
stage. But Terence made an innovation in
the Roman: all his plays have double actions; for
it was his custom to translate two Greek comedies,
and to weave them into one of his, yet so, that
both their actions were comical, and one was principal,
the other but secondary or subservient. And
this has obtained on the English stage, to give us
the pleasure of variety.</p>

<p><span class="pgnm">245</span><a id="page_245" name="page_245"></a>
As the action ought to be one, it ought, as such,
to have order in it; that is, to have a natural beginning,
a middle, and an end. A natural beginning,
says Aristotle, is that which could not necessarily
have been placed after another thing; and so of the
rest. This consideration will arraign all plays after
the new model of Spanish plots, where accident is
heaped upon accident, and that which is first might
as reasonably be last; an inconvenience not to be
remedied, but by making one accident naturally
produce another, otherwise it is a farce and not a
play. Of this nature is the "Slighted Maid;" where
there is no scene in the first act, which might not by
as good reason be in the fifth. And if the action
ought to be one, the tragedy ought likewise to
conclude with the action of it. Thus in "Mustapha,"
the play should naturally have ended with
the death of Zanger, and not have given us the
grace-cup after dinner, of Solyman's divorce from
Roxolana.</p>

<p>The following properties of the action are so
easy, that they need not my explaining. It ought
to be great, and to consist of great persons, to distinguish
it from comedy, where the action is trivial,
and the persons of inferior rank. The last quality
of the action is, that it ought to be probable, as
well as admirable and great. It is not necessary
that there should be historical truth in it; but always
necessary that there should be a likeness of
truth, something that is more than barely possible;
<i>probable</i> being that which succeeds, or happens,
oftener than it misses. To invent therefore a probability
and to make it wonderful, is the most difficult
undertaking in the art of poetry; for that,
which is not wonderful, is not great; and that, which
is not probable, will not delight a reasonable audience.
<span class="pgnm">246</span><a id="page_246" name="page_246"></a>
This action, thus described, must be represented
and not told, to distinguish dramatic poetry
from epic: but I hasten to the end or scope of tragedy,
which is, to rectify or purge our passions,
fear and pity.</p>

<p>To instruct delightfully is the general end of all
poetry. Philosophy instructs, but it performs its
work by precept; which is not delightful, or not
so delightful as example. To purge the passions
by example, is therefore the particular instruction
which belongs to tragedy. Rapin, a judicious critic,
has observed from Aristotle, that pride and
want of commiseration are the most predominant
vices in mankind; therefore, to cure us of these
two, the inventors of tragedy have chosen to work
upon two other passions, which are, fear and pity.
We are wrought to fear, by their setting before our
eyes some terrible example of misfortune, which
happened to persons of the highest quality; for
such an action demonstrates to us, that no condition
is privileged from the turns of fortune; this
must of necessity cause terror in us, and consequently
abate our pride. But when we see that
the most virtuous, as well as the greatest, are not
exempt from such misfortunes, that consideration
moves pity in us, and insensibly works us to be
helpful to, and tender over, the distressed; which
is the noblest and most godlike of moral virtues,
Here it is observable, that it is absolutely necessary
to make a man virtuous, if we desire he should be
pitied: we lament not, but detest, a wicked man;
we are glad when we behold his crimes are punished,
and that poetical justice is done upon him.
Euripides was censured by the critics of his time,
for making his chief characters too wicked; for
example, Phædra, though she loved her son-in-law
with reluctancy, and that it was a curse upon her
<span class="pgnm">247</span><a id="page_247" name="page_247"></a>
family for offending Venus, yet was thought too
ill a pattern for the stage. Shall we therefore banish
all characters of villainy? I confess I am not
of that opinion; but it is necessary that the hero
of the play be not a villain; that is, the characters,
which should move our pity, ought to have virtuous
inclinations, and degrees of moral goodness in
them. As for a perfect character of virtue, it never
was in nature, and therefore there can be no imitation
of it; but there are allays of frailty to be allowed
for the chief persons, yet so that the good
which is in them shall outweigh the bad, and consequently
leave room for punishment on the one
side, and pity on the other.</p>

<p>After all, if any one will ask me, whether a tragedy
cannot be made upon any other grounds than
those of exciting pity and terror in us;&mdash;Bossu, the
best of modern critics, answers thus in general:
That all excellent arts, and particularly that of
poetry, have been invented and brought to perfection
by men of a transcendent genius; and that,
therefore, they, who practise afterwards the same
arts, are obliged to tread in their footsteps, and to
search in their writings the foundation of them;
for it is not just that new rules should destroy the
authority of the old. But Rapin writes more particularly
thus, that no passions in a story are so
proper to move our concernment, as fear and pity;
and that it is from our concernment we receive our
pleasure, is undoubted. When the soul becomes
agitated with fear for one character, or hope for
another; then it is that we are pleased in tragedy,
by the interest which we take in their adventures.</p>

<p>Here, therefore, the general answer may be given
to the first question, how far we ought to imitate
Shakespeare and Fletcher in their plots; namely,
that we ought to follow them so far only, as they
<span class="pgnm">248</span><a id="page_248" name="page_248"></a>
have copied the excellencies of those who invented
and brought to perfection dramatic poetry; those
things only excepted, which religion, custom of
countries, idioms of languages, &amp;c. have altered in
the superstructures, but not in the foundation of
the design.</p>

<p>How defective Shakespeare and Fletcher have
been in all their plots, Mr Rymer has discovered
in his criticisms. Neither can we, who follow
them, be excused from the same, or greater errors;
which are the more unpardonable in us, because
we want their beauties to countervail our faults.
The best of their designs, the most approaching to
antiquity, and the most conducing to move pity, is
the "King and no King;" which, if the farce of
Bessus were thrown away, is of that inferior sort
of tragedies, which end with a prosperous event.
It is probably derived from the story of &OElig;dipus,
with the character of Alexander the Great, in his
extravagances, given to Arbaces. The taking of
this play, amongst many others, I cannot wholly
ascribe to the excellency of the action; for I find
it moving when it is read. It is true, the faults of
the plot are so evidently proved, that they can no
longer be denied. The beauties of it must therefore
lie either in the lively touches of the passion;
or we must conclude, as I think we may, that even
in imperfect plots there are less degrees of nature,
by which some faint emotions of pity and terror are
raised in us; as a less engine will raise a less proportion
of weight, though not so much as one of
Archimedes's making; for nothing can move our
nature, but by some natural reason, which works
upon passions. And, since we acknowledge the effect,
there must be something in the cause.</p>

<p>The difference between Shakespeare and Fletcher,
in their plottings, seems to be this; that Shakespeare
<span class="pgnm">249</span><a id="page_249" name="page_249"></a>
generally moves more terror, and Fletcher
more compassion: for the first had a more masculine,
a bolder, and more fiery genius; the second,
a more soft and womanish. In the mechanic beauties
of the plot, which are the observation of the
three unities, time, place, and action, they are both
deficient; but Shakespeare most. Ben Jonson reformed
those errors in his comedies, yet one of
Shakespeare's was regular before him; which is,
"The Merry Wives of Windsor." For what remains
concerning the design, you are to be referred
to our English critic. That method which he has
prescribed to raise it, from mistake, or ignorance of
the crime, is certainly the best, though it is not the
only; for amongst all the tragedies of Sophocles,
there is but one, &OElig;dipus, which is wholly built after
that model.</p>

<p>After the plot, which is the foundation of the
play, the next thing to which we ought to apply
our judgment, is the manners; for now the poet
comes to work above ground. The ground-work,
indeed, is that which is most necessary, as that upon
which depends the firmness of the whole fabric;
yet it strikes not the eye so much, as the beauties
or imperfections of the manners, the thoughts, and
the expressions.</p>

<p>The first rule which Bossu prescribes to the writer
of an heroic poem, and which holds too by the
same reason in all dramatic poetry, is to make the
moral of the work; that is, to lay down to yourself
what that precept of morality shall be, which you
would insinuate into the people; as, namely, Homer's
(which I have copied in my "Conquest of
Granada,") was, that union preserves a commonwealth
and discord destroys it. Sophocles, in his
&OElig;dipus, that no man is to be accounted happy before
his death. It is the moral that directs the
<span class="pgnm">250</span><a id="page_250" name="page_250"></a>
whole action of the play to one centre; and that
action or fable is the example built upon the moral,
which confirms the truth of it to our experience.
When the fable is designed, then, and not
before, the persons are to be introduced, with their
manners, characters, and passions.</p>

<p>The manners, in a poem, are understood to be
those inclinations, whether natural or acquired,
which move and carry us to actions, good, bad, or
indifferent, in a play; or which incline the persons
to such or such actions. I have anticipated part of
this discourse already, in declaring that a poet
ought not to make the manners perfectly good in
his best persons; but neither are they to be more
wicked in any of his characters, than necessity requires.
To produce a villain, without other reason
than a natural inclination to villainy, is, in poetry,
to produce an effect without a cause; and to make
him more a villain than he has just reason to be,
is to make an effect which is stronger than the
cause.</p>

<p>The manners arise from many causes; and are
either distinguished by complexion, as choleric and
phlegmatic, or by the differences of age or sex, of
climates, or quality of the persons, or their present
condition. They are likewise to be gathered from
the several virtues, vices, or passions, and many
other common-places, which a poet must be supposed
to have learned from natural philosophy,
ethics, and history; of all which, whosoever is ignorant,
does not deserve the name of poet.</p>

<p>But as the manners are useful in this art, they
may be all comprised under these general heads:
First, they must be apparent; that is, in every character
of the play, some inclinations of the person
must appear; and these are shown in the actions
and discourse. Secondly, the manners must be
<span class="pgnm">251</span><a id="page_251" name="page_251"></a>
suitable, or agreeing to the persons; that is, to the
age, sex, dignity, and the other general heads of
manners: thus, when a poet has given the dignity
of a king to one of his persons, in all his actions
and speeches, that person must discover majesty,
magnanimity, and jealousy of power, because these
are suitable to the general manners of a king<a class="ftnt" href="#Troil_3-1">[1]</a>. The
third property of manners is resemblance; and this
is founded upon the particular characters of men,
as we have them delivered to us by relation or history;
that is, when a poet has the known character
of this or that man before him, he is bound to
represent him such, at least not contrary to that
which fame has reported him to have been. Thus,
it is not a poet's choice to make Ulysses choleric,
or Achilles patient, because Homer has described
them quite otherwise. Yet this is a rock, on which
ignorant writers daily split; and the absurdity is as
monstrous, as if a painter should draw a coward
running from a battle, and tell us it was the picture
of Alexander the Great.</p>

<p>The last property of manners is, that they be
constant and equal, that is, maintained the same
through the whole design: thus, when Virgil had
once given the name of <i>pious</i> to &AElig;neas, he was
<span class="pgnm">252</span><a id="page_252" name="page_252"></a>
bound to show him such, in all his words and actions
through the whole poem. All these properties
Horace has hinted to a judicious observer.&mdash;1.
<i>Notandi sunt tibi mores;</i> 2. <i>Aut famam sequere,</i>
3. <i>aut sibi concenientia finge;</i> 4. <i>Sercetur ad imum,
qualis ab incepto processerit, et sibi constet.</i></p>

<p>From the manners, the characters of persons are
derived; for, indeed, the characters are no other
than the inclinations, as they appear in the several
persons of the poem; a character being thus defined,&mdash;that
which distinguishes one man from another.
Not to repeat the same things over again,
which have been said of the manners, I will only
add what is necessary here. A character, or that
which distinguishes one man from all others, cannot
be supposed to consist of one particular virtue, or
vice, or passion only; but it is a composition of
qualities which are not contrary to one another in
the same person. Thus, the same man may be liberal
and valiant, but not liberal and covetous; so in
a comical character, or humour, (which is an inclination
to this or that particular folly) Falstaff is a
liar, and a coward, a glutton, and a buffoon, because
all these qualities may agree in the same man; yet
it is still to be observed, that one virtue, vice, and
passion, ought to be shown in every man, as predominant
over all the rest; as covetousness in Crassus,
love of his country in Brutus; and the same in
characters which are feigned.</p>

<p>The chief character or hero in a tragedy, as I
have already shown, ought in prudence to be such
a man, who has so much more of virtue in him than
of vice, that he may be left amiable to the audience,
which otherwise cannot have any concernment
for his sufferings; and it is on this one character,
that the pity and terror must be principally,
if not wholly, founded: a rule which is extremely
<span class="pgnm">253</span><a id="page_253" name="page_253"></a>
necessary, and which none of the critics, that I know,
have fully enough discovered to us. For terror and
compassion work but weakly when they are divided
into many persons. If Creon had been the chief
character in "&OElig;dipus," there had neither been terror
nor compassion moved; but only detestation of the
man, and joy for his punishment; if Adrastus and
Eurydice had been made more appearing0characters,
then the pity had been divided, and lessened on the
part of &OElig;dipus. But making &OElig;dipus the best and
bravest person, and even Jocasta but an underpart
to him, his virtues, and the punishment of his fatal
crime, drew both the pity, and the terror to himself.</p>

<p>By what has been said of the manners, it will be
easy for a reasonable man to judge, whether the
characters be truly or falsely drawn in a tragedy;
for if there be no manners appearing in the characters,
no concernment for the persons can be raised;
no pity or horror can be moved, but by vice or
virtue; therefore, without them, no person can have
any business in the play. If the inclinations be obscure,
it is a sign the poet is in the dark, and knows
not what manner of man he presents to you; and
consequently you can have no idea, or very imperfect,
of that man; nor can judge what resolutions
he ought to take; or what words or actions are proper
for him. Most comedies, made up of accidents
or adventures, are liable to fall into this error; and
tragedies with many turns are subject to it; for the
manners can never be evident, where the surprises
of fortune take up all the business of the stage; and
where the poet is more in pain, to tell you what
happened to such a man, than what he was. It is
one of the excellencies of Shakespeare, that the manners
of his persons are generally apparent; and you
see their bent and inclinations. Fletcher comes far
<span class="pgnm">254</span><a id="page_254" name="page_254"></a>
short of him in this, as indeed he does almost in
every thing. There are but glimmerings of manners
in most of his comedies, which run upon
adventures; and in his tragedies, Rollo, Otto,
the King and no King, Melantius, and many
others of his best, are but pictures shown you in the
twilight; you know not whether they resemble vice
or virtue, and they are either good, bad, or indifferent,
as the present scene requires it. But of all
poets, this commendation is to be given to Ben Jonson,
that the manners even of the most inconsiderable
persons in his plays, are every where apparent.</p>

<p>By considering the second quality of manners,
which is, that they be suitable to the age, quality,
country, dignity, &amp;c. of the character, we may likewise
judge whether a poet has followed nature. In
this kind, Sophocles and Euripides have more excelled
among the Greeks than &AElig;schylus; and Terence
more than Plautus, among the Romans. Thus,
Sophocles gives to &OElig;dipus the true qualities of a
king, in both those plays which bear his name; but
in the latter, which is the "&OElig;dipus Coloneus," he
lets fall on purpose his tragic style; his hero speaks
not in the arbitrary tone; but remembers, in the
softness of his complaints, that he is an unfortunate
blind old man; that he is banished from his country,
and persecuted by his next relations. The present
French poets are generally accused, that wheresoever
they lay the scene, or in whatsoever age, the
manners of their heroes are wholly French. Racine's
Bajazet is bred at Constantinople; but his civilities
are conveyed to him, by some secret passage,
from Versailles into the seraglio. But our Shakespeare,
having ascribed to Henry the Fourth the
character of a king and of a father, gives him the
perfect manners of each relation, when either he
transacts with his son or with his subjects. Fletcher,
<span class="pgnm">255</span><a id="page_255" name="page_255"></a>
on the other side, gives neither to Arbaces,
nor to his king, in "The Maid's Tragedy," the
qualities which are suitable to a monarch; though
he may be excused a little in the latter, for the king
there is not uppermost in the character; it is the lover
of Evadne, who is king only in a second consideration;
and though he be unjust, and has other
faults which shall be nameless, yet he is not the
hero of the play. It is true, we find him a lawful
prince, (though I never heard of any king that was
in Rhodes) and therefore Mr Rymer's criticism
stands good,&mdash;that he should not be shown in so
vicious a character. Sophocles has been more judicious
in his "Antigona;" for, though he represents
in Creon a bloody prince, yet he makes him
not a lawful king, but an usurper, and Antigona
herself is the heroine of the tragedy: but when
Philaster wounds Arethusa and the boy; and Perigot
his mistress, in the "Faithful Shepherdess,"
both these are contrary to the character of manhood.
Nor is Valentinian managed much better;
for, though Fletcher has taken his picture truly, and
shown him as he was, an effeminate, voluptuous
man, yet he has forgotten that he was an emperor,
and has given him none of those royal marks, which
ought to appear in a lawful successor of the throne.
If it be enquired, what Fletcher should have done
on this occasion; ought he not to have represented
Valentinian as he was;&mdash;Bossu shall answer this
question for me, by an instance of the like nature:
Mauritius, the Greek emperor, was a prince far surpassing
Valentinian, for he was endued with many
kingly virtues; he was religious, merciful, and valiant,
but withal he was noted of extreme covetousness,
a vice which is contrary to the character
of a hero, or a prince: therefore, says the critic,
that emperor was no fit person to be represented in
<span class="pgnm">256</span><a id="page_256" name="page_256"></a>
a tragedy, unless his good qualities were only to be
shown, and his covetousness (which sullied them
all) were slurred over by the artifice of the poet.
To return once more to Shakespeare; no man ever
drew so many characters, or generally distinguished
them better from one another, excepting only Jonson.
I will instance but in one, to show the copiousness
of his invention; it is that of Caliban, or
the monster, in "The Tempest." He seems there
to have created a person which was not in nature,
a boldness which, at first sight, would appear intolerable;
for he makes him a species of himself,
begotten by an incubus on a witch; but this, as I
have elsewhere proved, is not wholly beyond the
bounds of credibility, at least the vulgar still believe
it. We have the separated notions of a spirit,
and of a witch; (and spirits, according to Plato, are
vested with a subtle body; according to some of
his followers, have different sexes;) therefore, as
from the distinct apprehensions of a horse, and of
a man, imagination has formed a centaur; so, from
those of an incubus and a sorceress, Shakespeare has
produced his monster. Whether or no his generation
can be defended, I leave to philosophy; but of
this I am certain, that the poet has most judiciously
furnished him with a person, a language, and a
character, which will suit him, both by father's and
mother's side: he has all the discontents, and malice
of a witch, and of a devil, besides a convenient
proportion of the deadly sins; gluttony, sloth, and
lust, are manifest; the dejectedness of a slave is
likewise given him, and the ignorance of one bred
up in a desert island. His person is monstrous, and
he is the product of unnatural lust; and his language
is as hobgoblin as his person; in all things
he is distinguished from other mortals. The characters
of Fletcher are poor and narrow, in comparison
<span class="pgnm">257</span><a id="page_257" name="page_257"></a>
of Shakspeare's; I remember not one which is
not borrowed from him; unless you will except that
strange mixture of a man in the "King and no
King;" so that in this part Shakespeare is generally
worth our imitation; and to imitate Fletcher is but
to copy after him who was a copyer.</p>

<p>Under this general head of manners, the passions
are naturally included, as belonging to the characters.
I speak not of pity and of terror, which are to
be moved in the audience by the plot; but of anger,
hatred, love, ambition, jealousy, revenge, &amp;c. as they
are shown in this or that person of the play. To
describe these naturally, and to move them artfully,
is one of the greatest commendations which can be
given to a poet: to write pathetically, says Longinus,
cannot proceed but from a lofty genius. A
poet must be born with this quality: yet, unless he
help himself by an acquired knowledge of the passions,
what they are in their own nature, and by
what springs they are to be moved, he will be subject
either to raise them where they ought not to
be raised, or not to raise them by the just degrees
of nature, or to amplify them beyond the natural
bounds, or not to observe the crisis and turns of
them, in their cooling and decay; all which errors
proceed from want of judgment in the poet, and
from being unskilled in the principles of moral philosophy.
Nothing is more frequent in a fanciful
writer, than to foil himself by not managing his
strength; therefore, as, in a wrestler, there is first
required some measure of force, a well-knit body
and active limbs, without which all instruction
would be vain; yet, these being granted, if he want
the skill which is necessary to a wrestler, he shall
make but small advantage of his natural robustuousness:
so, in a poet, his inborn vehemence and force
of spirit will only run him out of breath the sooner,
<span class="pgnm">258</span><a id="page_258" name="page_258"></a>
if it be not supported by the help of art. The
roar of passion, indeed, may please an audience,
three parts of which are ignorant enough to think
all is moving which is noisy, and it may stretch the
lungs of an ambitious actor, who will die upon the
spot for a thundering clap; but it will move no
other passion than indignation and contempt from
judicious men. Longinus, whom I have hitherto
followed, continues thus:&mdash;If the passions be artfully
employed, the discourse becomes vehement and
lofty: if otherwise, there is nothing more ridiculous
than a great passion out of season: and to this
purpose he animadverts severely upon &AElig;schylus,
who writ nothing in cold blood, but was always in
a rapture, and in fury with his audience: the inspiration
was still upon him, he was ever tearing
it upon the tripos; or (to run off as madly as he
does, from one similitude to another) he was always
at high-flood of passion, even in the dead ebb,
and lowest water-mark of the scene. He who
would raise the passion of a judicious audience,
says a learned critic, must be sure to take his hearers
along with him; if they be in a calm, 'tis in
vain for him to be in a huff: he must move them
by degrees, and kindle with them; otherwise he
will be in danger of setting his own heap of stubble
on fire, and of burning out by himself, without
warming the company that stand about him. They
who would justify the madness of poetry from the
authority of Aristotle, have mistaken the text,
and consequently the interpretation: I imagine it
to be false read, where he says of poetry, that it is
<span class="Greek" title="Euphuous &ecirc; manikou">
&Epsilon;&upsilon;&phi;&upsilon;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;
&eta;
&mu;&alpha;&nu;&iota;&kappa;&omicron;&upsilon;,
</span> that it had always somewhat in it
either of a genius, or of a madman. 'Tis more probable
that the original ran thus, that poetry was
<span class="Greek" title="Euphuous ou manikou">
&Epsilon;&upsilon;&phi;&upsilon;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;
&omicron;&upsilon;
&mu;&alpha;&nu;&iota;&kappa;&omicron;&upsilon;,
</span> That it belongs to a witty man, but
not to a madman. Thus then the passions, as they
<span class="pgnm">259</span><a id="page_259" name="page_259"></a>
are considered simply and in themselves, suffer violence
when they are perpetually maintained at the
same height; for what melody can be made on
that instrument, all whose strings are screwed up
at first to their utmost stretch, and to the same
sound? But this is not the worst: for the characters
likewise bear a part in the general calamity, if you
consider the passions as embodied in them; for it
follows of necessity, that no man can be distinguished
from another by his discourse, when every man
is ranting, swaggering, and exclaiming with the
same excess: as if it were the only business of all
the characters to contend with each other for the
prize at Billingsgate; or that the scene of the tragedy
lay in Bethlem. Suppose the poet should intend
this man to be choleric, and that man to be
patient; yet when they are confounded in the
writing, you cannot distinguish them from one
another: for the man who was called patient and
tame, is only so before he speaks; but let his clack
be set a-going, and he shall tongue it as impetuously
and as loudly, as the arrantest hero in the
play. By this means, the characters are only distinct
in name; but, in reality, all the men and women
in the play are the same person. No man
should pretend to write, who cannot temper his
fancy with his judgment: nothing is more dangerous
to a raw horseman, than a hot-mouthed jade
without a curb.</p>

<p>It is necessary therefore for a poet, who would
concern an audience by describing of a passion,
first to prepare it, and not to rush upon it all at
once. Ovid has judiciously shown the difference
of these two ways, in the speeches of Ajax and
Ulysses: Ajax, from the very beginning, breaks out
into his exclamations, and is swearing by his
Maker,&mdash;<i>Agimus, proh Jupiter, inquit.</i> Ulysses,
<span class="pgnm">260</span><a id="page_260" name="page_260"></a>
on the contrary, prepares his audience with all the
submissiveness he can practise, and all the calmness
of a reasonable man; he found his judges in a
tranquillity of spirit, and therefore set out leisurely
and softly with them, till he had warmed them by
degrees; and then he began to mend his pace, and
to draw them along with his own impetuousness:
yet so managing his breath, that it might not fail
him at his need, and reserving his utmost proofs of
ability even to the last. The success, you see, was
answerable; for the crowd only applauded the speech
of Ajax;&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem pi">
<p>Vulgique secutum ultima murmur erat:&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p class="noind">But the judges awarded the prize, for which they
contended, to Ulysses;</p>

<div class="poem pi">
<p>Mota manus procerum est; et quid facundia posset</p>
<p>Tum patuit, fortisque viri tulit arma disertus.</p>
</div>

<p>The next necessary rule is, to put nothing into
the discourse, which may hinder your moving of
the passions. Too many accidents, as I have said,
incumber the poet, as much as the arms of Saul
did David; for the variety of passions, which they
produce, are ever crossing and justling each other
out of the way. He, who treats of joy and grief
together, is in a fair way of causing neither of
those effects. There is yet another obstacle to be
removed, which is,&mdash;pointed wit, and sentences affected
out of season; these are nothing of kin to
the violence of passion: no man is at leisure to
make sentences and similes, when his soul is in
an agony. I the rather name this fault, that it
may serve to mind me of my former errors; neither
will I spare myself, but give an example of this
<span class="pgnm">261</span><a id="page_261" name="page_261"></a>
kind from my "Indian Emperor." Montezuma, pursued
by his enemies, and seeking sanctuary, stands
parleying without the fort, and describing his danger
to Cydaria, in a simile of six lines;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>As on the sands the frighted traveller</p>
<p>Sees the high seas come rolling from afar, &amp;c.</p>
</div>

<p>My Indian potentate was well skilled in the sea
for an inland prince, and well improved since the
first act, when he sent his son to discover it. The
image had not been amiss from another man, at
another time: <i>Sed nunc non erat his locus:</i> he destroyed
the concernment which the audience might
otherwise have had for him; for they could not
think the danger near, when he had the leisure to
invent a simile.</p>

<p>If Shakespeare be allowed, as I think he must, to
have made his characters distinct, it will easily be
inferred, that he understood the nature of the passions:
because it has been proved already, that confused
passions make distinguishable characters: yet
I cannot deny that he has his failings; but they
are not so much in the passions themselves, as in
his manner of expression: he often obscures his
meaning by his words, and sometimes makes it unintelligible.
I will not say of so great a poet, that
he distinguished not the blown puffy stile, from
true sublimity; but I may venture to maintain,
that the fury of his fancy often transported him
beyond the bounds of judgment, either in coining
of new words and phrases, or racking words which
were in use, into the violence of a catachresis. It is
not that I would explode the use of metaphors
from passion, for Longinus thinks them necessary
to raise it: but to use them at every word, to say
nothing without a metaphor, a simile, an image, or
<span class="pgnm">262</span><a id="page_262" name="page_262"></a>
description; is, I doubt, to smell a little too strongly
of the buskin. I must be forced to give an example
of expressing passion figuratively; but that
I may do it with respect to Shakespeare, it shall
not be taken from any thing of his: it is an exclamation
against Fortune, quoted in his Hamlet, but
written by some other poet:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! all you gods,</p>
<p>In general synod, take away her power;</p>
<p>Break all the spokes and felleys from her wheel,</p>
<p>And bowl the round nave down the hill of heav'n,</p>
<p>As low as to the fiends.</p>
</div>

<p class="noind">And immediately after, speaking of Hecuba, when
Priam was killed before her eyes:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>But who, ah woe! had seen the mobled queen</p>
<p>Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flame</p>
<p>With bisson rheum; a clout about that head,</p>
<p>Where late the diadem stood; and, for a rob</p>
<p>About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins,</p>
<p>A blanket in th' alarm of fear caught up.</p>
<p>Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd</p>
<p>'Gainst fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd;</p>
<p>But if the gods themselves did see her then,</p>
<p>When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport</p>
<p>In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,</p>
<p>The instant burst of clamour that she made</p>
<p>(Unless things mortal move them not at all)</p>
<p>Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,</p>
<p>And passion in the gods.</p>
</div>

<p>What a pudder is here kept in raising the expression
of trifling thoughts! would not a man have
thought that the poet had been bound prentice to
a wheel-wright, for his first rant? and had followed
a rag-man, for the clout and blanket, in the second?
Fortune is painted on a wheel, and therefore the
writer, in a rage, will have poetical justice done
<span class="pgnm">263</span><a id="page_263" name="page_263"></a>
upon every member of that engine: after this execution,
he bowls the nave down-hill, from heaven,
to the fiends: (an unreasonable long mark, a man
would think;) 'tis well there are no solid orbs to
stop it in the way, or no element of fire to consume
it: but when it came to the earth, it must be
monstrous heavy, to break ground as low as the
center. His making milch the burning eyes of
heaven, was a pretty tolerable flight too: and I
think no man ever drew milk out of eyes before
him: yet, to make the wonder greater, these eyes
were burning. Such a sight indeed were enough
to have raised passion in the gods; but to excuse
the effects of it, he tells you, perhaps they did not
see it. Wise men would be glad to find a little
sense couched under all these pompous words; for
bombast is commonly the delight of that audience,
which loves poetry, but understands it not: and as
commonly has been the practice of those writers,
who, not being able to infuse a natural passion into
the mind, have made it their business to ply the
ears, and to stun their judges by the noise. But
Shakespeare does not often thus; for the passions in
his scene between Brutus and Cassius are extremely
natural, the thoughts are such as arise from the
matter, the expression of them not viciously figurative.
I cannot leave this subject, before I do justice
to that divine poet, by giving you one of his
passionate descriptions: 'tis of Richard the Second
when he was deposed, and led in triumph through
the streets of London by Henry of Bolingbroke: the
painting of it is so lively, and the words so moving
that I have scarce read any thing comparable to it,
in any other language. Suppose you have seen already
the fortunate usurper passing through the
crowd, and followed by the shouts and acclamations
of the people; and now behold King Richard
<span class="pgnm">264</span><a id="page_264" name="page_264"></a>
entering upon the scene: consider the wretchedness
of his condition, and his carriage in it; and refrain
from pity, if you can:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>As in a theatre, the eyes of men,</p>
<p>After a well-grac'd actor leaves the stage,</p>
<p>Are idly bent on him that enters next,</p>
<p>Thinking his prattle to be tedious:</p>
<p>Even so, or with much more contempt, men's eyes</p>
<p>Did scowl on Richard: no man cry'd, God save him:</p>
<p>No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home,</p>
<p>But dust was thrown upon his sacred head,</p>
<p>Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,</p>
<p>His face still combating with tears and smiles,</p>
<p>(The badges of his grief and patience)</p>
<p>That had not God (for some strong purpose) steel'd</p>
<p>The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted,</p>
<p>And barbarism itself have pitied him.</p>
</div>

<p>To speak justly of this whole matter: it is neither
height of thought that is discommended, nor pathetic
vehemence, nor any nobleness of expression
in its proper place; but it is a false measure of all
these, something which is like them, and is not
them: it is the Bristol-stone, which appears like a
diamond; it is an extravagant thought, instead of a
sublime one; it is roaring madness, instead of vehemence;
and a sound of words, instead of sense. If
Shakespeare were stripped of all the bombasts in his
passions, and dressed in the most vulgar words, we
should find the beauties of his thoughts remaining;
if his embroideries were burnt down, there would
still be silver at the bottom of the melting-pot:
but I fear (at least let me fear it for myself) that
we, who ape his sounding words, have nothing of
his thought, but are all outside; there is not so
much as a dwarf within our giant's clothes. Therefore,
let not Shakespeare suffer for our sakes; it is our
fault, who succeed him in an age which is more refined,
if we imitate him so ill, that we copy his
<span class="pgnm">265</span><a id="page_265" name="page_265"></a>
failings only, and make a virtue of that in our writings,
which in his was an imperfection.</p>

<p>For what remains, the excellency of that poet
was, as I have said, in the more manly passions;
Fletcher's in the softer: Shakespeare writ better betwixt
man and man; Fletcher, betwixt man and
woman: consequently, the one described friendship
better; the other love: yet Shakespeare taught
Fletcher to write love: and Juliet and Desdemona
are originals. It is true, the scholar had the softer
soul; but the master had the kinder. Friendship
is both a virtue and a passion essentially; love is a
passion only in its nature, and is not a virtue but
by accident: good nature makes friendship; but
effeminacy love. Shakespeare had an universal
mind, which comprehended all characters and passions;
Fletcher a more confined and limited: for
though he treated love in perfection, yet honour,
ambition, revenge, and generally all the stronger,
passions, he either touched not, or not masterly.
To conclude all, he was a limb of Shakespeare.</p>

<p>I had intended to have proceeded to the last property
of manners, which is, that they must be constant,
and the characters maintained the same from
the beginning to the end; and from thence to have
proceeded to the thoughts and expressions suitable
to a tragedy: but I will first see how this will relish
with the age. It is, I confess, but cursorily written;
yet the judgment, which is given here, is generally
founded upon experience: but because many
men are shocked at the name of rules, as if they
were a kind of magisterial prescription upon poets,
I will conclude with the words of Rapin, in his Reflections
on Aristotle's Work of Poetry: "If the
rules be well considered, we shall find them to be
made only to reduce nature into method, to trace her
step by step, and not to suffer the least mark of her
<span class="pgnm">266</span><a id="page_266" name="page_266"></a>
to escape us: it is only by these, that probability in
fiction is maintained, which is the soul of poetry.
They are founded upon good sense, and sound reason,
rather than on authority; for though Aristotle
and Horace are produced, yet no man must argue,
that what they write is true, because they writ it;
but 'tis evident, by the ridiculous mistakes and gross
absurdities, which have been made by those poets
who have taken their fancy only for their guide,
that if this fancy be not regulated, it is a mere caprice,
and utterly incapable to produce a reasonable
and judicious poem."</p>

<li><a id="Troil_3-1" name="Troil_3-1"></a>The <i>dictum</i> of Rymer, concerning the royal prerogative in
poetry, is thus expressed: "We are to presume the highest virtues,
where we find the highest of rewards; and though it is not
necessary that all heroes should be kings, yet, undoubtedly, all
crowned heads, by poetical right, are heroes. This character is
a flower; a prerogative so certain, so inseparably annexed to the
crown, as by no parliament of poets ever to be invaded." <i>The
Tragedies of the last Age considered,</i> p. 61. Dryden has elsewhere
given his assent to this maxim, that a king, in poetry, as in
our constitution, can do no wrong. The only apology for introducing
a tyrant upon the stage, was to make him at the same
time an usurper.</li>

SPOKEN BY MR BETTERTON,<br />
REPRESENTING THE GHOST OF SHAKESPEARE.</h3>


<div class="poem">
<p>See, my loved Britons, see your Shakespeare rise,</p>
<p>An awful ghost confessed to human eyes!</p>
<p>Unnamed, methinks, distinguished I had been</p>
<p>From other shades, by this eternal green,</p>
<p>About whose wreaths the vulgar poets strive,</p>
<p>And with a touch, their withered bays revive.</p>
<p>Untaught, unpractised, in a barbarous age,</p>
<p>I found not, but created first the stage.</p>
<p>And, if I drained no Greek or Latin store,</p>
<p>'Twas, that my own abundance gave me more.</p>
<p>On foreign trade I needed not rely,</p>
<p>Like fruitful Britain, rich without supply.</p>
<p>In this my rough-drawn play, you shall behold</p>
<p>Some master-strokes, so manly and so bold,</p>
<p>That he who meant to alter, found 'em such,</p>
<p>He shook, and thought it sacrilege to touch.</p>
<p>Now, where are the successors to my name?</p>
<p>What bring they to fill out a poet's fame?</p>
<p>Weak, short-lived issues of a feeble age;</p>
<p>Scarce living to be christened on the stage!</p>
<p>For humour farce, for love they rhyme dispense,</p>
<p>That tolls the knell for their departed sense.</p>
<p>Dulness might thrive in any trade but this:</p>
<p>'Twould recommend to some fat benefice.</p>
<p>Dulness, that in a playhouse meets disgrace,</p>
<p>Might meet with reverence, in its proper place.</p>
<p>The fulsome clench, that nauseates the town,</p>
<p>Would from a judge or alderman go down,</p>
<p>Such virtue is there in a robe and gown!</p>
<p>And that insipid stuff which here you hate,</p>
<p>Might somewhere else be called a grave debate;</p>
<p>Dulness is decent in the church and state.</p>
<p>But I forget that still 'tis understood,</p>
<p>Bad plays are best decried by showing good.</p>
<p>Sit silent then, that my pleased soul may see</p>
<p>A judging audience once, and worthy me;</p>
<span class="pgnm">268</span><a id="page_268" name="page_268"></a>
<p>My faithful scene from true records shall tell,</p>
<p>How Trojan valour did the Greek excell;</p>
<p>Your great forefathers shall their fame regain,</p>
<p>And Homer's angry ghost repine in vain<a class="ftnt" href="#Troil_4-1">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>Footnote:</p>
<ol>
<li><a id="Troil_4-1" name="Troil_4-1"></a>The conceit, which our ancestors had adopted, of their descent from
Brutus, a fugitive Trojan, induced their poets to load the Grecian chiefs with
every accusation of cowardice and treachery, and to extol the character of
the Trojans in the same proportion. Hector is always represented as having
been treacherously slain.</li>

<h3 class="chap">TROILUS AND CRESSIDA</h3>

<h4 class="scn">ACT I.<br />
SCENE I.&mdash;<i>A Camp.</i></h4>

<p class="sdn">Enter <span class="cnm">Agamemnon, Ulysses, Diomedes,</span> and
<span class="cnm">Nestor.</span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Agam.</span> Princes, it seems not strange to us, nor new,<br />
That, after nine years siege, Troy makes defence,<br />
Since every action of recorded fame<br />
Has with long difficulties been involved,<br />
Not answering that idea of the thought,<br />
Which gave it birth; why then, you Grecian chiefs,<br />
With sickly eyes do you behold our labours,<br />
And think them our dishonour, which indeed<br />
Are the protractive trials of the gods,<br />
To prove heroic constancy in men?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Nest.</span> With due observance of thy sovereign seat,<br />
Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply<br />
Thy well-weighed words. In struggling with misfortunes<br />
Lies the true proof of virtue: On smooth seas,<br />
How many bauble-boats dare set their sails,<br />
And make an equal way with firmer vessels!<br />
But let the tempest once enrage that sea,<br />
And then behold the strong-ribbed argosie,<br />
Bounding between the ocean and the air,<br />
Like Perseus mounted on his Pegasus.<br />
<span class="pgnm">270</span><a id="page_270" name="page_270"></a>
Then where are those weak rivals of the main?<br />
Or, to avoid the tempest, fled to port,<br />
Or made a prey to Neptune. Even thus<br />
Do empty show, and true-prized worth, divide<br />
In storms of fortune.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ulys.</span> Mighty Agamemnon!<br />
Heart of our body, soul of our designs,<br />
In whom the tempers, and the minds of all<br />
Should be inclosed,&mdash;hear what Ulysses speaks.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Agam.</span> You have free leave.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ulys.</span> Troy had been down ere this, and Hector's sword<br />
Wanted a master, but for our disorders:<br />
The observance due to rule has been neglected,<br />
Observe how many Grecian tents stand void<br />
Upon this plain, so many hollow factions:<br />
For, when the general is not like the hive,<br />
To whom the foragers should all repair,<br />
What honey can our empty combs expect?<br />
Or when supremacy of kings is shaken,<br />
What can succeed? How could communities,<br />
Or peaceful traffic from divided shores,<br />
Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,<br />
But by degree, stand on their solid base?<br />
Then every thing resolves to brutal force,<br />
And headlong force is led by hoodwinked will.<br />
For wild ambition, like a ravenous wolf,<br />
Spurred on by will, and seconded by power,<br />
Must make an universal prey of all,<br />
And last devour itself.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Nest.</span> Most prudently Ulysses has discovered<br />
The malady, whereof our state is sick.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Diom.</span> 'Tis truth he speaks; the general's disdained<br />
By him one step beneath, he by the next;<br />
That next by him below: So each degree<br />
Spurns upward at superior eminence.<br />
Thus our distempers are their sole support;<br />
<span class="pgnm">271</span><a id="page_271" name="page_271"></a>
Troy in our weakness lives, not in her strength.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Agam.</span> The nature of this sickness found, inform us<br />
From whence it draws its birth?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ulys.</span> The great Achilles, whom opinion crowns<br />
The chief of all our host,<br />
Having his ears buzzed with his noisy fame,<br />
Disdains thy sovereign charge, and in his tent<br />
Lies, mocking our designs; with him Patroclus,<br />
Upon a lazy bed, breaks scurril jests,<br />
And with ridiculous and aukward action,<br />
Which, slanderer, he imitation calls,<br />
Mimics the Grecian chiefs.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Agam.</span> As how, Ulysses?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ulys.</span> Even thee, the king of men, he does not spare,<br />
(The monkey author) but thy greatness pageants,<br />
And makes of it rehearsals: like a player,<br />
Bellowing his passion till he break the spring,<br />
And his racked voice jar to his audience;<br />
So represents he thee, though more unlike<br />
Than Vulcan is to Venus.<br />
And at this fulsome stuff,&mdash;the wit of apes,&mdash;<br />
The large Achilles, on his prest bed lolling,<br />
From his deep chest roars out a loud applause,<br />
Tickling his spleen, and laughing till he wheeze.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Nest.</span> Nor are you spared, Ulysses; but, as you speak in council,<br />
He hems ere he begins, then strokes his beard,<br />
Casts down his looks, and winks with half an eye;<br />
Has every action, cadence, motion, tone,<br />
All of you but the sense.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Agam.</span> Fortune was merry<br />
When he was born, and played a trick on nature,<br />
To make a mimic prince; he ne'er acts ill,<br />
But when he would seem wise:<br />
For all he says or does, from serious thought,<br />
Appears so wretched, that he mocks his title,<br />
<span class="pgnm">272</span><a id="page_272" name="page_272"></a>
And is his own buffoon.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ulys.</span> In imitation of this scurril fool,<br />
Ajax is grown self-willed as broad Achilles.<br />
He keeps a table too, makes factious feasts,<br />
Rails on our state of war, and sets Thersites<br />
(A slanderous slave of an o'erflowing gall)<br />
To level us with low comparisons.<br />
They tax our policy with cowardice,<br />
Count wisdom of no moment in the war,<br />
In brief, esteem no act, but that of hand;<br />
The still and thoughtful parts, which move those hands,<br />
With them are but the tasks cut out by fear,<br />
To be performed by valour.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Agam.</span> Let this be granted, and Achilles' horse<br />
Is more of use than he; but you, grave pair,<br />
Like Time and Wisdom marching hand in hand,<br />
Must put a stop to these encroaching ills:<br />
To you we leave the care;<br />
You, who could show whence the distemper springs,<br />
Must vindicate the dignity of kings.<span class="sdr">[Exeunt.</span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Troil.</span> Why should I fight without the Trojan walls,<br />
Who, without fighting, am o'erthrown within?<br />
The Trojan who is master of a soul,<br />
Let him to battle; Troilus has none.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pand.</span> Will this never be at an end with you?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Troil.</span> The Greeks are strong, and skilful to their strength,<br />
Fierce to their skill, and to their fierceness wary;<br />
But I am weaker than a woman's tears,<br />
Tamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance,<br />
And artless as unpractised infancy.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pand</span> Well, I have told you enough of this; for
<span class="pgnm">273</span><a id="page_273" name="page_273"></a>
my part I'll not meddle nor make any further in
your love; he, that will eat of the roastmeat, must
stay for the kindling of the fire.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Troil.</span> Have I not staid?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pand.</span> Ay, the kindling; but you must stay the
spitting of the meat.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Troil.</span> Have I not staid?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pand.</span> Ay, the spitting; but there's two words to
a bargain; you must stay the roasting too.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Troil.</span> Still have I staid; and still the farther off.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pand.</span> That's but the roasting, but there's more
in this word stay; there's the taking off the spit,
the making of the sauce, the dishing, the setting on
the table, and saying grace; nay, you must stay
the cooling too, or you may chance to burn your
chaps.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Troil.</span> At Priam's table pensive do I sit,<br />
And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts&mdash;<br />
(Can she be said to come, who ne'er was absent!)</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pand.</span> Well, she's a most ravishing creature; and
she looked yesterday most killingly; she had such
a stroke with her eyes, she cut to the quick with
every glance of them.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Troil.</span> I was about to tell thee, when my heart<br />
Was ready with a sigh to cleave in two,<br />
Lest Hector or my father should perceive me,<br />
I have, with mighty anguish of my soul,<br />
Just at the birth, stifled this still-born sigh,<br />
And forced my face into a painful smile.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pand.</span> I measured her with my girdle yesterday;
she's not half a yard about the waist, but so taper a
shape did I never see; but when I had her in my
arms, Lord, thought I,&mdash;and by my troth I could not
forbear sighing,&mdash;If prince Troilus had her at this advantage
and I were holding of the door!&mdash;An she
were a thought taller,&mdash;but as she is, she wants not
an inch of Helen neither; but there's no more comparison
<span class="pgnm">274</span><a id="page_274" name="page_274"></a>
between the women&mdash;there was wit, there
was a sweet tongue! How her words melted in her
mouth! Mercury would have been glad to have
such a tongue in his mouth, I warrant him. I
would somebody had heard her talk yesterday, as
I did.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Troil.</span> Oh Pandarus, when I tell thee I am mad<br />
In Cressid's love, thou answer'st she is fair;<br />
Praisest her eyes, her stature, and her wit;<br />
But praising thus, instead of oil and balm,<br />
Thou lay'st, in every wound her love has given me,<br />
The sword that made it.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pand.</span> I give her but her due.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Troil.</span> Thou giv'st her not so much.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pand.</span> Faith, I'll speak no more of her, let her be
as she is; if she be a beauty, 'tis the better for her;
an' she be not, she has the mends in her own hands,
for Pandarus.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Troil.</span> In spite of me, thou wilt mistake my meaning.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pand.</span> I have had but my labour for my pains; ill
thought on of her, and ill thought on of you; gone
between and between, and am ground in the mill-stones
for my labour.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Troil.</span> What, art thou angry, Pandarus, with thy friend?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pand.</span> Because she's my niece, therefore she's not
so fair as Helen; an' she were not my niece, show
me such another piece of woman's flesh: take her
limb by limb: I say no more, but if Paris had seen
her first, Menelaus had been no cuckold: but what
care I if she were a blackamoor? what am I the better
for her face?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Troil.</span> Said I she was not beautiful?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pand.</span> I care not if you did; she's a fool to stay
behind her father Calchas: let her to the Greeks;
and so I'll tell her. For my part, I am resolute, I'll
meddle no more in your affairs.</p>

in the battle, but he'll lay about him; he'll

And there's Troilus will not come far behind him:
let them take heed of Troilus, I can tell them that

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Thers.</span> Shall the idiot Ajax use me thus? he beats
me, and I rail at him. O worthy satisfaction! would
I could but beat him, and he railed at me! Then
there's Achilles, a rare engineer; if Troy be not taken
till these two undermine it, the walls will stand
till they fall of themselves. Now the plague on the
whole camp, or rather the pox; for that's a curse
dependent on those that fight, as we do, for a cuckold's

bless thee from a tutor, and discipline come
not near thee!&mdash;I have said my prayers; and the

and I die to have my spleen tickled.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Thers.</span> I'll decline the whole question. Agamemnon
commands Achilles; Achilles is my benefactor;
I am Patroclus's knower; and Patroclus is a fool.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Patro.</span> You rascal!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Achil,</span> He is a privileged man; proceed, Thersites.
Ha, ha, ha! pr'ythee, proceed, while I am in
the vein of laughing.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Thers.</span> And all these foresaid men are fools. Agamemnon's
a fool, to offer to command Achilles;
Achilles is a fool, to be commanded by him; I am
a fool, to serve such a fool; and Patroclus is a fool
positive.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Patro.</span> Why am I a fool?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Thers.</span> Make that demand to heaven; it suffices
me, thou art one.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Acini.</span> Ha, ha, ha! O give me ribs of steel, or I
shall split with pleasure.&mdash;Now play me Nestor at
a night alarm: mimick him rarely; make him cough
and spit, and fumble with his gorget, and shake the
rivets with his palsy hand, in and out, in and out;
gad, that's exceeding foolish.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Patro.</span> Nestor shall not escape so; he has told us
what we are. Come, what's Nestor?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Thers.</span> Why, he is an old wooden top, set up by
father Time three hundred years ago, that hums to
Agamemnon and Ulysses, and sleeps to all the world
besides.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Achil.</span> So let him sleep, for I'll no more of him.&mdash;O,
my Patroclus, I but force a smile; Ajax has
drawn the lot, and all the praise of Hector must be
his.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Thers.</span> I hope to see his praise upon his shoulders,
in blows and bruises; his arms, thighs, and body,
all full of fame, such fame as he gave me; and a

upon him, and discover the inside of a fool.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Patro.</span> How he struts in expectation of honour!
he knows not what he does.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Thers.</span> Nay, that's no wonder, for he never did.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Achil.</span> Pr'ythee, say how he behaves himself?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Thers.</span> O, you would be learning to practise against
such another time?&mdash;Why, he tosses up his head as
he had built castles in the air; and he treads upward
to them, stalks into the element; he surveys
himself, as it were to look for Ajax: he would be
cried, for he has lost himself; nay, he knows nobody;
I said, "Good-morrow, Ajax," and he replied,
"Thanks, Agamemnon."</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Achil.</span> Thou shalt be my ambassador to him, Thersites.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Thers.</span> No, I'll put on his person; let Patroclus
make his demands to me, and you shall see the
pageant of Ajax.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Achil.</span> To him, Patroclus; tell him I humbly desire
the valiant Ajax to invite the noble Hector to
my tent; and to procure safe conduct for him from
our captain general Agamemnon.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Thers.</span> No; but he's thus out of tune. What

out his brains, I know not, nor I care not; but if
emptiness makes noise, his head will make melody.</p>

<h3 class="chap">THE SPANISH FRIAR.</h3>

<p>The Spanish Friar, or the Double Discovery, is one of the best
and most popular of our poet's dramatic efforts. The plot is,
as Johnson remarks, particularly happy, for the coincidence
and coalition of the tragic and comic plots. The grounds for this
eminent critic's encomium will be found to lie more deep than
appears at first sight. It was, indeed, a sufficiently obvious connection,
to make the gay Lorenzo an officer of the conquering
army, and attached to the person of Torrismond. This expedient
could hardly have escaped the invention of the most vulgar playwright,
that ever dovetailed tragedy and comedy together. The
felicity of Dryden's plot, therefore, does not consist in the ingenuity
of his original conception, but in the minutely artificial strokes,
by which the reader is perpetually reminded of the dependence of
the one part of the play on the other. These are so frequent, and
appear so very natural, that the comic plot, instead of diverting our
attention from the tragic business, recals it to our mind by constant
and unaffected allusion. No great event happens in the higher region
of the camp or court, that has not some indirect influence
upon the intrigues of Lorenzo and Elvira; and the part which
the gallant is called upon to act in the revolution that winds
up the tragic interest, while it is highly in character, serves
to bring the catastrophe of both parts of the play under the eye
of the spectator, at one and the same time. Thus much seemed
necessary to explain the felicity of combination, upon which
Dryden justly valued himself, and which Johnson sanctioned by
his high commendation. But, although artfully conjoined, the
different departments of this tragi-comedy are separate subjects
of critical remark.</p>

<p>The comic part of the Spanish Friar, as it gives the first title
to the play, seems to claim our first attention. Indeed, some precedence
is due to it in another point of view; for, though the
tragic scenes may be matched in All for Love, Don Sebastian,
and else where, the Spanish Friar contains by far the most happy
of Dryden's comic effusions. It has, comparatively speaking, this
high claim to commendation, that, although the intrigue is licentious,
according to the invariable licence of the age, the language is,
in general, free from the extreme and disgusting coarseness, which
our author too frequently mistook for wit, or was contented to
substitute in its stead. The liveliness and even brilliancy of the
<span class="pgnm">368</span><a id="page_368" name="page_368"></a>
dialogue, shows that Dryden, from the stores of his imagination,
could, when he pleased, command that essential requisite
of comedy; and that, if he has seldom succeeded, it was only
because he mistook the road, or felt difficulty in travelling
it. The character of Dominic is of that broadly ludicrous nature,
which was proper to the old comedy. It would be difficult
to show an ordinary conception more fully brought out. He is,
like Falstaff, a compound of sensuality and talent, finely varied
by the professional traits with which it suited the author's purpose
to adorn his character. Such an addition was, it is true,
more comic than liberal; but Dryden, whose constant dislike to
the clerical order glances out in many of his performances, was
not likely to be scrupulous, when called upon to pourtray one
of their members in his very worst colours. To counterbalance
the Friar's scandalous propensities of every sort, and to render
him an object of laughter, rather than abhorrence, the author has
gifted this reprobate churchman with a large portion of wit; by
means of which, and by a ready presence of mind, always indicative
of energy, he preserves an ascendence over the other characters,
and escapes detection and disgrace, until poetical justice,
and the conclusion of the play, called for his punishment. We
have a natural indulgence for an amusing libertine; and, I believe,
that, as most readers commiserate the disgrace of Falstaff,
a few may be found to wish that Dominic's penance had been of
a nature more decent and more theatrical than the poet has assigned
him<a class="ftnt" href="#Spani_1-1">[1]</a>. From the dedication, as well as the prologue, it
appears that Dryden, however contrary to his sentiments at a
future period, was, at present, among those who held up to contempt
and execration the character of the Roman catholic priesthood.
By one anonymous lampoon, this is ascribed to a temporary
desertion of the court party, in resentment for the loss,
or discontinuance of his pension. This allowance, during the
pressure upon the Exchequer, was, at least, irregularly paid, of
which Dryden repeatedly complains, and particularly in a letter
to the Earl of Rochester. But the hardship was owing entirely
to the poverty of the public purse; and, when the anonymous
libeller affirms, that Dryden's pension was withdrawn, on account
of his share in the Essay on Satire, he only shows that his veracity
<span class="pgnm">369</span><a id="page_369" name="page_369"></a>
is on a level with his poverty<a class="ftnt" href="#Spani_1-2">[2]</a>. The truth seems to be, that
Dryden partook in some degree of the general ferment which the
discovery of the Popish Plot had excited; and we may easily suppose
him to have done so without any impeachment to his monarchial
tenets, since North himself admits, that at the first
opening of the plot, the chiefs of the loyal party joined in the
cry. Indeed, that mysterious transaction had been investigated
by none more warmly than by Danby, the king's favourite
minister, and a high favourer of the prerogative. Even when
writing Absalom and Achitophel, our author by no means avows
an absolute disbelief of the whole plot, while condemning the extraordinary
exaggerations, by which it had been rendered the
means of much bloodshed and persecution<a class="ftnt" href="#Spani_1-3">[3]</a>. It seems, therefore,
fair to believe, that, without either betraying or disguising his own
principles, he chose, as a popular subject for the drama, an attack
<span class="pgnm">370</span><a id="page_370" name="page_370"></a>
upon an obnoxious priesthood, whom he, in common with all the
nation, believed to have been engaged in the darkest intrigues
against the king and government. I am afraid that this task was
the more pleasing, from that prejudice against the clergy, of all countries
and religions, which, as already noticed, our author displays, in
common with other wits of that licentious age<a class="ftnt" href="#Spani_1-4">[4]</a>. The character of
the Spanish Friar was not, however, forgotten, when Dryden became
a convert to the Roman Catholic persuasion; and, in many
instances, as well as in that just quoted, it was assumed as the
means of fixing upon him a charge of inconsistency in politics,
and versatility in religion<a class="ftnt" href="#Spani_1-5">[5]</a>.</p>

<p>The tragic part of the "Spanish Friar" has uncommon merit.
The opening of the Drama, and the picture of a besieged town in
the last extremity, is deeply impressive, while the description of
the noise of the night attack, and the gradual manner in which
the intelligence of its success is communicated, arrests the attention,
and prepares expectation for the appearance of the hero,
with all the splendour which ought to attend the principal character
in tragedy. The subsequent progress of the plot is liable
to a capital objection, from the facility with which the queen,
amiable and virtuous, as we are bound to suppose her, consents
to the murder of the old dethroned monarch. We question if the
operation of any motive, however powerful, could have been pleaded
<span class="pgnm">371</span><a id="page_371" name="page_371"></a>
with propriety, in apology for a breach of theatrical decorum,
so gross, and so unnatural. But, in fact, the queen is only actuated
by a sort of reflected ambition, a desire to secure to her lover
a crown, which she thought in danger; but which, according to
her own statement, she only valued on his account. This is surely
too remote and indirect a motive, to urge a female to so horrid
a crime. There is also something vilely cold-hearted, in her attempt
to turn the guilt and consequences of her own crime upon
Bertran, who, whatever faults he might have to others, was to
the queen no otherwise obnoxious, than because the victim of
her own inconstancy. The gallant, virtuous, and enthusiastic character
of Torrismond, must be allowed, in some measure, to counterbalance
that of his mistress, however unhappily he has placed
his affections. But the real excellence of these scenes consists
less in peculiarity of character, than in the vivacity and power of
the language, which, seldom sinking into vulgarity, or rising into
bombast, maintains the mixture of force and dignity, best adapted
to the expression of tragic passion. Upon the whole, as the
comic part of this play is our author's master-piece in comedy,
the tragic plot may be ranked with his very best efforts of that
kind, whether in "Don Sebastian," or "All for Love."</p>

<p>The "Spanish Friar" appears to have been brought out shortly
after Mr Thynne's murder, which is alluded to in the Prologue,
probably early in 1681-2. The whimsical caricature, which it
presented to the public, in Father Dominic, was received with rapture
by the prejudiced spectators, who thought nothing could be
exaggerated in the character of a Roman Catholic priest. Yet,
the satire was still more severe in the first edition, and afterwards
considerably softened<a class="ftnt" href="#Spani_1-6">[6]</a>. It was, as Dryden himself calls it,
a Protestant play; and certainly, as Jeremy Collier somewhere
says, was rare Protestant diversion, and much for the credit
of the Reformation. Accordingly, the "Spanish Friar" was
the only play prohibited by James II. after his accession; an interdict,
which may be easily believed no way disagreeable to
the author, now a convert to the Roman church. It is very
remarkable, that, after the Revolution, it was the first play represented
by order of queen Mary, and honoured with her presence;
a choice, of which she had abundant reason to repent, as
the serious part of the piece gave as much scope for malicious application
against herself, as the comic against the religion of her
father<a class="ftnt" href="#Spani_1-7">[7]</a>.</p>

<p>"The only day her Majesty gave herself the diversion of a play, and that
on which she designed to see another, has furnished the town with discourse
for near a month. The choice of the play was THE SPANISH FRIAR, the
only play forbid by the late K[ing], Some unhappy expressions, among
which those that follow, put her in some disorder, and forced her to hold up
her fan, and often look behind her, and call for her palatine and hood, and
any thing she could next think of; while those who were in the pit before
her, turned their heads over their shoulders, and all in general directed their
looks towards her, whenever their fancy led them to make any application of
what was said. In one place, where the queen of Arragon is going to church
in procession, 'tis said by a spectator, 'Very good; she usurps the throne,
keeps the old king in prison, and, at the same time, is praying for a blessing
on her army;'&mdash;And when said, 'That 'tis observed at Court, who weeps,
and who wears black for good king Sancho's death,' 'tis said, 'Who is that,
that can flatter a Court like this? Can I sooth tyranny? seem pleas'd to see
my Royal Master murthered; his crown usurped; a distaff in the throne?'&mdash;And
'What title has this queen, but lawless force; and force must pull her
down'&mdash;Twenty more things are said, which may be wrested to what they
were never designed: but however, the observations then made furnished
the town with talk, till something else happened, which gave it much occasion
for discourse; for another play being ordered to be acted, the queen
came not, being taken up with other diversion. She dined with Mrs Gradens,
the famous woman in the hall, that sells fine laces and head-dresses;
from thence she went to the Jew's, that sells Indian things; to Mrs Ferguson's,
De Vett's, Mrs Harrison's, and other Indian houses; but not to Mrs
Potter's, though in her way; which caused Mrs Potter to say, that she might
as well have hoped for that honour as others, considering that the whole design
of bringing the queen and king was managed at her house, and the consultations
held there; so that she might as well have thrown away a little
money in raffling there, as well as at the other houses: but it seems that my
lord Devonshire has got Mrs Potter to be laundress: she has not much countenance
of the queen, her daughter still keeping the Indian house her mother
had. The same day the queen went to one Mrs Wise's, a famous woman
for telling fortunes, but could not prevail with her to tell anything;
though to others she has been very true, and has foretold that king James
shall came in again, and the duke of Norfolk shall lose his head: the last, I
suppose, will naturally be the consequence of the first. These things, however
innocent, have passed the censure of the town: and, besides a private
reprimand given, the king gave one in <i>public</i>; saying to the queen, that he
heard she dined at a bawdy-house, and desired the next time she went, he
might go. She said, she had done nothing but what the late queen had done.
He asked her, if she meant to make her, her example. More was said on
this occasion than ever was known before; but it was borne with all the submission
of a good wife, who leaves all to the direction of the k&mdash;&mdash;, and diverts
herself with walking six or seven miles a-day, and looking after her buildings,
making of fringes, and such like innocent things; and does not meddle
in government, though she has better title to do it than the late queen had."</p></li>

<h3 class="chap">TO
THE RIGHT HONOURABLE
JOHN,
LORD HAUGHTON<a class="ftnt" href="#Spani_2-1">[1]</a>.</h3>

<p class="smcap">My Lord,</p>

<p>When I first designed this play, I found, or
thought I found, somewhat so moving in the serious
part of it, and so pleasant in the comic, as
might deserve a more than ordinary care in both;
accordingly, I used the best of my endeavour,
in the management of two plots, so very different
from each other, that it was not perhaps the
talent of every writer to have made them of a
piece. Neither have I attempted other plays of the
<span class="pgnm">374</span><a id="page_374" name="page_374"></a>
same nature, in my opinion, with the same judgment,
though with like success. And though many
poets may suspect themselves for the fondness and
partiality of parents to their youngest children, yet
I hope I may stand exempted from this rule, because
I know myself too well to be ever satisfied
with my own conceptions, which have seldom reached
to those ideas that I had within me; and consequently,
I may presume to have liberty to judge
when I write more or less pardonably, as an ordinary
marksman may know certainly when he shoots
less wide at what he aims. Besides, the care and
pains I have bestowed on this, beyond my other
tragi-comedies, may reasonably make the world conclude,
that either I can do nothing tolerably, or
that this poem is not much amiss. Few good pictures
have been finished at one sitting; neither can
a true just play, which is to bear the test of ages,
be produced at a heat, or by the force of fancy,
without the maturity of judgment. For my own
part, I have both so just a diffidence of myself, and
so great a reverence for my audience, that I dare
venture nothing without a strict examination; and
am as much ashamed to put a loose indigested play
upon the public, as I should be to offer brass money
in a payment; for though it should be taken, (as it
is too often on the stage) yet it would be found in
the second telling; and a judicious reader will discover,
in his closet, that trashy stuff, whose glittering
deceived him in the action. I have often heard
the stationer sighing in his shop, and wishing for
those hands to take off his melancholy bargain,
which clapped its performance on the stage. In a
playhouse, every thing contributes to impose upon
the judgment; the lights, the scenes, the habits,
and, above all, the grace of action, which is commonly
the best where there is the most need of it,
<span class="pgnm">375</span><a id="page_375" name="page_375"></a>
surprise the audience, and cast a mist upon their
understandings; not unlike the cunning of a juggler,
who is always staring us in the face, and over-whelming
us with gibberish, only that he may gain
the opportunity of making the cleaner conveyance
of his trick. But these false beauties of the stage
are no more lasting than a rainbow; when the actor
ceases to shine upon them, when he gilds them
no longer with his reflection, they vanish in a
twinkling. I have sometimes wondered, in the
reading, what was become of those glaring colours
which amazed me in "Bussy D'Amboys" upon the
theatre; but when I had taken up what I supposed
a fallen star, I found I had been cozened with a
jelly<a class="ftnt" href="#Spani_2-2">[2]</a>; nothing but a cold, dull mass, which glittered
no longer than it was shooting; a dwarfish
thought, dressed up in gigantic words, repetition
in abundance, looseness of expression, and gross
hyperboles; the sense of one line expanded prodigiously
into ten; and, to sum up all, uncorrect
English, and a hideous mingle of false poetry, and
true nonsense; or, at best, a scantling of wit, which
lay gasping for life, and groaning beneath a heap of
rubbish. A famous modern poet used to sacrifice every
year a Statius to Virgil's manes<a class="ftnt" href="#Spani_2-3">[3]</a>; and I have indignation
<span class="pgnm">376</span><a id="page_376" name="page_376"></a>
enough to burn a D'AMBOIS annually, to
the memory of Jonson<a class="ftnt" href="#Spani_2-4">[4]</a>. But now, my lord, I am
sensible, perhaps too late, that I have gone too far:
for, I remember some verses of my own Maximin
and Almanzor, which cry vengeance upon me for
their extravagance, and which I wish heartily in
the same fire with Statius and Chapman. All I
can say for those passages, which are, I hope, not
many, is, that I knew they were bad enough to
please, even when I wrote them; but I repent of
them amongst my sins; and, if any of their fellows
intrude by chance into my present writings, I draw
<span class="pgnm">377</span><a id="page_377" name="page_377"></a>
a stroke over all those Dalilah's of the theatre; and
am resolved I will settle myself no reputation by
the applause of fools. It is not that I am mortified
to all ambition, but I scorn as much to take it from
half-witted judges, as I should to raise an estate by
cheating of bubbles. Neither do I discommend the
lofty style in tragedy, which is naturally pompous
and magnificent; but nothing is truly sublime, that
is not just and proper. If the antients had judged
by the same measure, which a common reader
takes, they had concluded Statius to have written
higher than Virgil, for,</p>

<div class="poem pi">
<p>Quæ super-imposito moles geminata Colosso</p>
</div>

<p class="noind"><span class="pgnm">378</span><a id="page_378" name="page_378"></a>
carries a more thundering kind of sound, than</p>

<div class="poem pi">
<p>Tityre, tu patulæ recubans sub tegmine fagi:</p>
</div>

<p class="noind">yet Virgil had all the majesty of a lawful prince,
and Statius only the blustering of a tyrant. But
when men affect a virtue which they cannot easily
reach, they fall into a vice, which bears the nearest
resemblance to it. Thus, an injudicious poet,
who aims at loftiness, runs easily into the swelling
puffy style, because it looks like greatness. I remember,
when I was a boy, I thought inimitable
Spencer a mean poet, in comparison of Sylvester's
"Dubartas," and was wrapt into an ecstasy when I
read these lines:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>Now, when the winter's keener breath began</p>
<p>To crystalize the Baltic ocean;</p>
<p>To glaze the lakes, to bridle up the floods,</p>
<p>And periwig with snow the bald-pate woods:&mdash;<a class="ftnt" href="#Spani_2-5">[5]</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pgnm">379</span><a id="page_379" name="page_379"></a>
I am much deceived if this be not abominable
fustian, that is, thoughts and words ill-sorted, and
without the least relation to each other; yet I dare
not answer for an audience, that they would not
clap it on the stage: so little value there is to be
given to the common cry, that nothing but madness
can please madmen, and the poet must be of a
piece with the spectators, to gain a reputation with
them. But, as in a room, contrived for state, the
height of the roof should bear a proportion to the
area; so, in the heightenings of poetry, the strength
and vehemence of figures should be suited to the
occasion, the subject, and the persons. All beyond
this is monstrous: it is out of nature, it is an excrescence,
and not a living part of poetry. I had
not said thus much, if some young gallants, who
pretend to criticism, had not told me, that this tragi-comedy
wanted the dignity of style; but, as a
man, who is charged with a crime of which he
thinks himself innocent, is apt to be too eager in
his own defence; so, perhaps, I have vindicated
my play with more partiality than I ought, or than
such a trifle can deserve. Yet, whatever beauties
it may want, it is free at least from the grossness
of those faults I mentioned: what credit it has
gained upon the stage, I value no farther than in
reference to my profit, and the satisfaction I had, in
seeing it represented with all the justness and gracefulness
of action. But, as it is my interest to please
my audience, so it is my ambition to be read: that
I am sure is the more lasting and the nobler design:
for the propriety of thoughts and words, which are
the hidden beauties of a play, are but confusedly
judged in the vehemence of action: all things are
there beheld, as in a hasty motion, where the objects
only glide before the eye, and disappear. The
most discerning critic can judge no more of these
<span class="pgnm">380</span><a id="page_380" name="page_380"></a>
silent graces in the action, than he who rides post
through an unknown country can distinguish the
situation of places, and the nature of the soil. The
purity of phrase, the clearness of conception and
expression, the boldness maintained to majesty, the
significancy and sound of words, not strained into
bombast, but justly elevated; in short, those very
words and thoughts, which cannot be changed, but
for the worse, must of necessity escape our transient
view upon the theatre; and yet, without all
these, a play may take. For, if either the story
move us, or the actor help the lameness of it with
his performance, or now and then a glittering beam
of wit or passion strike through the obscurity of
the poem, any of these are sufficient to effect a present
liking, but not to fix a lasting admiration; for
nothing but truth can long continue; and time is
the surest judge of truth. I am not vain enough
to think that I have left no faults in this, which that
touchstone will not discover; neither, indeed, is it
possible to avoid them in a play of this nature.
There are evidently two actions in it; but it will
be clear to any judicious man, that with half the
pains I could have raised a play from either of
them; for this time I satisfied my humour, which
was to tack two plays together; and to break a rule
for the pleasure of variety. The truth is, the audience
are grown weary of continued melancholy
scenes; and I dare venture to prophecy, that few
tragedies, except those in verse, shall succeed in
this age, if they are not lightened with a course of
mirth; for the feast is too dull and solemn without
the fiddles. But how difficult a task this is,
will soon be tried; for a several genius is required
to either way; and, without both of them, a man,
in my opinion, is but half a poet for the stage.
Neither is it so trivial an undertaking, to make a
<span class="pgnm">381</span><a id="page_381" name="page_381"></a>
tragedy end happily; for it is more difficult to save,
than it is to kill. The dagger and the cup of poison
are always in a readiness; but to bring the action
to the last extremity, and then by probable
means to recover all, will require the art and judgement
of a writer; and cost him many a pang in
the performance.</p>

<p>And now, my lord, I must confess, that what I
have written, looks more like a Preface, than a Dedication;
and, truly, it was thus far my design,
that I might entertain you with somewhat in my
own art, which might be more worthy of a noble
mind, than the stale exploded trick of fulsome
panegyrics. It is difficult to write justly on any
thing, but almost impossible in praise. I shall
therefore wave so nice a subject; and only tell
you, that, in recommending a protestant play to a
protestant patron, as I do myself an honour, so I
do your noble family a right, who have been always
eminent in the support and favour of our religion
and liberties. And if the promises of your youth,
your education at home, and your experience abroad,

<li><a id="Spani_2-3" name="Spani_2-3"></a>Dryden appears to have alluded to the following passage in
Strada, though without a very accurate recollection of its contents:
<i>"Sane Andreas Naugerius Valerio Martiali acriter infensus,
solemne jam habebat in illum aliquanto petulantius jocari.
Etenim natali suo, accitis ad geniale epulum amicis, postquam
prolixe de poeticæ laudibus super mensam disputaverat; ostensurum
se aiebat a cæna, quo tandem modo laudari poesim deceret: Mox
aferri jubebat Martialis volumen, (hæc erat mensæ appendix) atque
igni proprior factus, illustri conflagratione absumendum flammis
imponebat: addebatque eo incendio litare se Musis, Manibusque
Virgilij, cujus imitatorem cultoremque prestare se melius
haud posset, quam si vilia poetarum capita per undas insecutus ac
flammas perpetuo perdidisset. Nec se eo loco tenuit, sed cum
Silvas aliquot ab se conscriptas legisset, audissetque Statianu characteri
similes videri, iratus sibi, quod a Martiale fugiens alio declinasset
a Virgilio, cum primum se recessit domum, in Silvas
conjecit ignem."</i> <i>Stradæ Prolusiones</i>, Lib. II. Pro. 5. From
this passage, it is obvious, that it was Martial, not Statius, whom
Andreas Navagero sacrificed to Virgil, although he burned his
own verses when they were accused of a resemblance to the style
of the author of the Thebaid. In the same prolusion, Strada
quotes the "blustering" line, afterwards censured by Dryden;
but erroneously reads,<br /><br />

<li><a id="Spani_2-4" name="Spani_2-4"></a>"Bussy D'Ambois," a tragedy, once much applauded, was
the favourite production of George Chapman. If Dryden could
have exhausted every copy of this bombast performance in one
holocaust, the public would have been no great losers, as may be
apparent from the following quotations:<br /><br />

<div class="poem">
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Bussy.</span> I'll sooth his plots, and strew my hate with smiles,<br />
Till, all at once, the close mines of my heart<br />
Rise at full state, and rush into his blood.<br />
I'll bind his arm in silk, and rub his flesh,<br />
To make the veine swell, that his soule may gush<br />
Into some kennel, where it loves to lie;<br />
And policy be flanked with policy.<br />
Yet shall the feeling centre, where we meet.<br />
Groan with the weight of my approaching feet.<br />
I'll make the inspired threshold of his court<br />
Sweat with the weather of my horrid steps,<br />
Before I enter; yet, I will appear<br />
Like calm securitie, befor a ruin.<br />
A politician must, like lightning, melt<br />
The very marrow, and not taint the skin;<br />
His wayes must not be seen through, the superficies<br />
Of the green centre must not taste his feet,<br />
When hell is plowed up with the wounding tracts,<br />
And all his harvest reap't by hellish facts.</p>
</div>

<p>Montsurry, when he discovers that the Friar had acted as confident
in the intrigue betwixt his lady and d'Ambois, thus elegantly
expresses the common idea of the world being turned <i>upside
down.</i><br /><br /></p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="i1">Now, is it true, earth moves, and heaven stands still;</p>
<p>Even heaven itself must see and suffer ill.</p>
<p>The too huge bias of the world hath swayed</p>
<p>Her back-part upwards, and with <i>that</i> she braves</p>
<p>This hemisphere, that long her month hath mocked.</p>
<p>The gravity of her religious face,</p>
<p>Now grown too weighty with her sacrilege,</p>
<p>And here discerned sophisticate enough,</p>
<p>Turns to the antipodes, and all the forms</p>
<p>That here allusions have impressed in her,</p>
<p>Have eaten through her back, and now all see</p>
<p>How she is riveted with hypocrisie.</p>
</div>

<p>Yet, I observe, from the prologue to the edition of 1641, that
the part of D'Ambois was considered as a high test of a players'
talents:<br /><br /></p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="i1">&mdash;Field is gone,</p>
<p>Whose action first did give it name; and one</p>
<p>Who came the neatest to him, is denied,</p>
<p>By his grey beard, to shew the height and pride</p>
<p>Of d'Ambois' youth and braverie. Yet to hold</p>
<p>Our title still a-foot, and not grow cold,</p>
<p>By giving't o'er, a third man with his best</p>
<p>Of care and paines defends our interest.</p>
<p>As Richard he was liked, nor do we fear,</p>
<p>In personating d'Ambois, heile appear</p>
<p>To faint, or goe lesse, so your free consent,</p>
<p>As heretofore, give him encouragement.</p>
</div>

<p>I believe the successor of Field, in this once favourite character,
was Hart. The piece was revived after the Restoration with
great success.</p></li>

original has "periwig with <i>wool</i>."</li>

<h3 class="chap">PROLOGUE.</h3>

<div class="poem">
<p>Now, luck for us, and a kind hearty pit;</p>
<p>For he, who pleases, never fails of wit:</p>
<p>Honour is yours;</p>
<p>And you, like kings at city-treats, bestow it;</p>
<p>The writer kneels, and is bid rise a poet;</p>
<p>But you are fickle sovereigns, to our sorrow;</p>
<p>You dub to-day, and hang a man to-morrow:</p>
<p>You cry the same sense up, and down again,</p>
<p>Just like brass-money once a year in Spain:</p>
<p>Take you in the mood, whate'er base metal come,</p>
<p>You coin as fast as groats at Birmingham:</p>
<p>Though 'tis no more like sense, in antient plays,</p>
<p>Than Rome's religion like St Peter's days.</p>
<p>In short, so swift your judgments turn and wind,</p>
<p>You cast our fleetest wits a mile behind.</p>
<p>'Twere well your judgments but in plays did range,</p>
<p>But e'en your follies and debauches change</p>
<p>With such a whirl, the poets of our age</p>
<p>Are tired, and cannot score them on the stage;</p>
<p>Unless each vice in short-hand they indict,</p>
<p>Even as notch'd prentices whole sermons write<a class="ftnt" href="#Spani_3-1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>The heavy Hollanders no vices know,</p>
<p>But what they used a hundred years ago;</p>
<p>Like honest plants, where they were stuck, they grow.</p>
<p>They cheat, but still from cheating sires they come;</p>
<p>They drink, but they were christened first in mum.</p>
<p>Their patrimonial sloth the Spaniards keep,</p>
<p>And Philip first taught Philip how to sleep.</p>
<p>The French and we still change; but here's the curse,</p>
<p>They change for better, and we change for worse;</p>
<p>They take up our old trade of conquering,</p>
<p>And we are taking theirs, to dance and sing:</p>
<p>Our fathers did, for change, to France repair,</p>
<p>And they, for change, will try our English air;</p>
<p><span class="pgnm">383</span><a id="page_383" name="page_383"></a>
As children, when they throw one toy away,</p>
<p>Strait a more foolish gewgaw comes in play:</p>
<p>So we, grown penitent, on serious thinking,</p>
<p>Leave whoring, and devoutly fall to drinking.</p>
<p>Scowering the watch grows out-of-fashion wit:</p>
<p>Now we set up for tilting in the pit,</p>
<p>Where 'tis agreed by bullies chicken-hearted,</p>
<p>To fright the ladies first, and then be parted.</p>
<p>A fair attempt has twice or thrice been made,</p>
<p>To hire night murderers, and make death a trade<a class="ftnt" href="#Spani_3-2">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>When murder's out, what vice can we advance?</p>
<p>Unless the new-found poisoning trick of France:</p>
<p>And, when their art of rats-bane we have got,</p>
<p>By way of thanks, we'll send them o'er our plot.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Alph.</span> Stand: give the word.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ped.</span> The queen of Arragon.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ped.</span> She wears apace.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Alph.</span> Then welcome day-light; we shall have

<span class="cnm">Alph.</span> She has not been abed, but in her chapel<br />
All night devoutly watched, and bribed the saints<br />
With vows for her deliverance.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ped.</span> O, Alphonso!<br />
I fear they come too late. Her father's crimes<br />
Sit heavy on her, and weigh down her prayers.<br />
A crown usurped; a lawful king deposed,<br />
In bondage held, debarred the common light;<br />
His children murdered, and his friends destroyed,&mdash;<br />
What can we less expect than what we feel,<br />
And what we fear will follow?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Alph.</span> Heaven avert it!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ped.</span> Then heaven must not be heaven. Judge the event<br />
By what has passed. The usurper joyed not long<br />
His ill-got crown:&mdash;'tis true, he died in peace,&mdash;<br />
Unriddle that, ye powers!&mdash;but left his daughter,<br />
Our present queen, engaged upon his death-bed,<br />
To marry with young Bertran, whose cursed father<br />
Had helped to make him great.<br />
Hence, you well know, this fatal war arose;<br />
Because the Moor Abdalla, with whose troops<br />
The usurper gained the kingdom, was refused;<br />
And, as an infidel, his love despised.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Alph.</span> Well, we are soldiers, Pedro; and, like lawyers,<br />
Plead for our pay.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ped.</span> A good cause would do well though:<br />
It gives my sword an edge. You see this Bertran<br />
Has now three times been beaten by the Moors:<br />
What hope we have, is in young Torrismond,<br />
Your brother's son.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Alph.</span> He's a successful warrior,<br />
And has the soldiers' hearts: upon the skirts<br />

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ped.</span> Mine are drawn off<br />
To take a short repose.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Bert.</span> Short let it be:<br />
For, from the Moorish camp, this hour and more,<br />
There has been heard a distant humming noise,<br />
Like bees disturbed, and arming in their hives.<br />
What courage in our soldiers? Speak! What hope?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ped.</span> As much as when physicians shake their heads,<br />
And bid their dying patient think of heaven.<br />
Our walls are thinly manned; our best men slain;<br />
The rest, an heartless number, spent with watching,<br />
And harassed out with duty.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Bert.</span> Good-night all, then.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ped.</span> Nay, for my part, 'tis but a single life<br />
I have to lose. I'll plant my colours down<br />
In the mid-breach, and by them fix my foot;<br />
Say a short soldier's prayer, to spare the trouble<br />
Of my new friends above; and then expect<br />
The next fair bullet.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Alph.</span> Never was known a night of such distraction;<br />
Noise so confused and dreadful; jostling crowds.<br />
That run, and know not whither; torches gliding,<br />
Like meteors, by each other in the streets.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ped.</span> I met a reverend, fat, old gouty friar,&mdash;<br />
With a paunch swoll'n so high, his double chin<br />
Might rest upon it; a true son of the church;<br />
Fresh-coloured, well thriven on his trade,&mdash;<br />
<span class="pgnm">388</span><a id="page_388" name="page_388"></a>
Come puffing with his greasy bald-pate choir,<br />
And fumbling o'er his beads in such an agony,<br />
He told them false, for fear. About his neck<br />
There hung a wench, the label of his function,<br />
Whom he shook off, i'faith, methought, unkindly.<br />
It seems the holy stallion durst not score<br />
Another sin, before he left the world.</p>

<p class="sdn">Enter a Captain.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Capt.</span> To arms, my lord, to arms!<br />
From the Moors' camp the noise grows louder still:<br />
Rattling of armour, trumpets, drums, and ataballes;<br />
And sometimes peals of shouts that rend the heavens,<br />
Like victory: then groans again, and howlings,<br />
Like those of vanquished men; but every echo<br />
Goes fainter off, and dies in distant sounds.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Bert.</span> Some false attack: expect on t'other side.<br />
One to the gunners on St Jago's tower; bid them, for shame,<br />
Level their cannon lower: On my soul<br />

To carry over, and not hurt the Moor.</p>

frailty of a woman?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Lor.</span> O, I love an easy woman! there's such ado,
to crack a thick-shelled mistress; we break our

fall into ill hands at his first arrival.</p>

the hitching in my pace.</p>

I am a friar of honour, where I am engaged.</p>

why we are alone. Do you think the friar

god, very niggardly of his opportunities:
he must be watched like a hard-hearted treasurer;

SCENE I.&mdash;<i>Before Gomez's Door.</i></h4>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dom.</span> I'll not wag an ace farther: the whole

will digest these gross enormities no longer.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Lor.</span> How, thy conscience not digest them! There
is ne'er a friar in Spain can shew a conscience, that
comes near it for digestion. It digested pimping,
when I sent thee with my letter; and it digested
perjury, when thou swor'st thou didst not know me:
I am sure it has digested me fifty pounds, of as hard
gold as is in all Barbary. Pr'ythee, why shouldest
thou discourage fornication, when thou knowest
thou lovest a sweet young girl?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dom.</span> Away, away; I do not love them;&mdash;pah;

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dom.</span> You take a mighty pleasure in defamation,
colonel; but I wonder what you find in running
restless up and down, breaking your brains, emptying
your purse, and wearing out your body, with
hunting after unlawful game.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Lor.</span> Why there's the satisfaction on't.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dom.</span> This incontinency may proceed to adultery,

<span class="cnm">Lor.</span> I'll not hang alone, friar; I'm resolved to
peach thee before thy superiors, for what thou hast
done already.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dom.</span> I'm resolved to forswear it, if you do. Let
me advise you better, colonel, than to accuse a
church-man to a church-man; in the common cause
we are all of a piece; we hang together.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dom.</span> Nay, if you talk of peaching, I'll peach
first, and see whose oath will be believed; I'll trounce
you for offering to corrupt my honesty, and bribe
my conscience: you shall be summoned by an host
of parators; you shall be sentenced in the spiritual
court; you shall be excommunicated; you shall be
outlawed;&mdash;and&mdash;<br />

[<span class="sdm">In another tone.</span>] I say, a man might do this now,
if he were maliciously disposed, and had a mind to
bring matters to extremity: but, considering that
you are my friend, a person of honour, and a worthy
good charitable man, I would rather die a thousand
deaths than disoblige you.<br />
<span class="sdr">[<span class="cnm">Lorenzo</span> takes up the purse, and pours it into

Nay, good sir;&mdash;nay, dear colonel;&mdash;O lord, sir, what
are you doing now! I profess this must not be:
without this I would have served you to the utter-most;
pray command me.&mdash;A jealous, foul-mouthed
rogue this Gomez is; I saw how he used you, and
you marked how he used me too. O he's a bitter

we'll be revenged on him with a witness.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Lor.</span> But how shall I send her word to be ready

you, that I mean to carry her away this evening,
by the help of these two soldiers. I know Gomez
suspects you, and you will hardly gain admittance.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dom.</span> Let me alone; I fear him not. I am armed
with the authority of my clothing: yonder I see
him keeping sentry at his door:&mdash;have you never
seen a citizen, in a cold morning, clapping his sides,
and walking forward and backward, a mighty pace
before his shop? but I'll gain the pass, in spite of
his suspicion; stand you aside, and do but mark
how I accost him.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Lor.</span> If he meet with a repulse, we must throw
off the fox's skin, and put on the lion's.&mdash;Come,
gentlemen, you'll stand by me?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Sol.</span> Do not doubt us, colonel.

but her dear colonel, and conspiring cuckoldom
against me.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dom.</span> I dare say, you wrong her; she is employing
her thoughts how to cure you of your jealousy.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Gom.</span> Yes, by certainty.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dom.</span> By your leave, Gomez; I have some spiritual

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dom.</span> Indisposed, say you? O, it is upon those

opportunely.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Gom.</span> Ay, whose good angels sent you hither, that

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dom.</span> A word or two of devotion will do her no

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Gom.</span> A little sleep will do her more good, I'm
sure: You know, she disburthened her conscience
but this morning to you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dom.</span> But, if she be ill this afternoon, she may
have new occasion to confess.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Gom.</span> Indeed, as you order matters with the colonel,
she may have occasion of confessing herself
every hour.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dom.</span> Pray, how long has she been sick?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Gom.</span> Lord, you will force a man to speak;&mdash;why,
ever since your last defeat.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dom.</span> This can be but some slight indisposition;
it will not last, and I may see her.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Gom.</span> How, not last! I say, it will last, and it
shall last; she shall be sick these seven or eight
days, and perhaps longer, as I see occasion. What?
I know the mind of her sickness a little better than
you do.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dom.</span> I find, then, I must bring a doctor.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Gom.</span> And he'll bring an apothecary, with a chargeable
long bill of <i>ana's</i>: those of my family have the
grace to die cheaper. In a word, Sir Dominick, we
understand one another's business here: I am resolved
to stand like the Swiss of my own family, to
defend the entrance; you may mumble over your

my doors fly open, and batter down my walls with
bell, book, and candle; but I am not of opinion,
that you are holy enough to commit miracles.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dom.</span> Men of my order are not to be treated after
this manner.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Gom.</span> I would treat the pope and all his cardinals
in the same manner, if they offered to see my wife,
without my leave.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dom.</span> I excommunicate thee from the church, if
thou dost not open; there's promulgation coming
out.</p>

part of it, and saw the conclusion. I find we

suspecting a friar of the least good nature; what,

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dom.</span> I must confess, 'tis wrongful, <i>quoad hoc</i>, as
to the fact itself; but 'tis rightful, <i>quoad hunc</i>, as to
this heretical rogue, whom we must dispatch. He
has railed against the church, which is a fouler crime
than the murder of a thousand kings. <i>Omne majus
continet in se minus:</i> He, that is an enemy to the
church, is an enemy unto heaven; and he, that is an
enemy to heaven, would have killed the king if he
had been in the circumstances of doing it; so it is
not wrongful to accuse him.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Raym.</span> Are these, are these, ye powers, the promised joys,<br />
With which I flattered my long, tedious absence,<br />
To find, at my return, my master murdered?<br />
O, that I could but weep, to vent my passion!<br />
But this dry sorrow burns up all my tears.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Alph.</span> Mourn inward, brother; 'tis observed at court,<br />
Who weeps, and who wears black; and your return<br />
Will fix all eyes on every act of yours,<br />
To see how you resent King Sancho's death.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Raym.</span> What generous man can live with that constraint<br />
Upon his soul, to bear, much less to flatter,<br />
A court like this! Can I sooth tyranny?<br />
Seem pleased to see my royal master murdered,<br />
His crown usurped, a distaff in the throne,<br />
A council made of such as dare not speak,<br />
And could not, if they durst; whence honest men<br />
Banish themselves, for shame of being there:<br />
A government, that, knowing not true wisdom,<br />
Is scorned abroad, and lives on tricks at home?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Alph.</span> Virtue must be thrown off; 'tis a coarse garment,<br />
<span class="pgnm">450</span><a id="page_450" name="page_450"></a>
Too heavy for the sun-shine of a court.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Raym.</span> Well then, I will dissemble, for an end<br />
So great, so pious, as a just revenge:<br />
You'll join with me?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Alph.</span> No honest man but must.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ped.</span> What title has this queen, but lawless force?<br />
And force must pull her down.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Alph.</span> Truth is, I pity Leonora's case;<br />
Forced, for her safety, to commit a crime,<br />
Which most her soul abhors.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Raym.</span> All she has done, or e'er can do, of good,<br />
This one black deed has damned.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ped,</span> You'll hardly gain your son to our design.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Raym.</span> Your reason for't?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ped.</span> I want time to unriddle it:<br />
Put on your t'other face, the queen approaches.</p>

<p class="sdn">Enter <span class="cnm">Leonora, Bertran,</span> and Attendants.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Raym.</span> And that accursed Bertran<br />
Stalks close behind her, like a witch's fiend,<br />
Pressing to be employed; stand, and observe them.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Leo.</span> to <i>Bert.</i> Buried in private, and so suddenly!<br />
It crosses my design, which was to allow<br />
The rites of funeral fitting his degree,<br />
With all the pomp of mourning.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Bert.</span> It was not safe:<br />
Objects of pity, when the cause is new,<br />
Would work too fiercely on the giddy crowd:<br />
Had Cæsar's body never been exposed,<br />
Brutus had gained his cause.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Leo.</span> Then, was he loved?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Bert.</span> O, never man so much, for saint-like goodness.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ped.</span> Had bad men feared him, but as good men loved him,<br />
He had not yet been sainted.<span class="sdr">[Aside.</span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Leo.</span> I wonder how the people bear his death.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="pgnm">451</span><a id="page_451" name="page_451"></a>
<span class="cnm">Bert.</span> Some discontents there are; some idle murmurs.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ped.</span> How, idle murmurs! Let me plainly speak:<br />
The doors are all shut up; the wealthier sort,<br />
With arms across, and hats upon their eyes,<br />
Walk to and fro before their silent shops;<br />
Whole droves of lenders crowd the bankers' doors,<br />
To call in money; those, who have none, mark<br />
Where money goes; for when they rise, 'tis plunder:<br />
The rabble gather round the man of news,<br />
And listen with their mouths;<br />
Some tell, some hear, some judge of news, some make it;<br />
And he, who lies most loud, is most believed.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Leo.</span> This may be dangerous.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Raym.</span> Pray heaven it may!<span class="sdr">[Aside.</span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Bert.</span> If one of you must fall,<br />
Self-preservation is the first of laws;<br />
And if, when subjects are oppressed by kings,<br />
They justify rebellion by that law,<br />
As well may monarchs turn the edge of right<br />
To cut for them, when self-defence requires it.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Leo.</span> You place such arbitrary power in kings,<br />
That I much fear, if I should make you one,<br />
You'll make yourself a tyrant; let these know<br />
By what authority you did this act.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Bert.</span> You much surprise me, to demand that question:<br />
But, since truth must be told, 'twas by your own.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Leo.</span> Produce it; or, by heaven, your head shall answer<br />
The forfeit of your tongue.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Raym.</span> Brave mischief towards.<span class="sdr">[Aside.</span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Bert.</span> You bade me.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Leo.</span> When, and where?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Bert.</span> No, I confess, you bade me not in words;<br />
The dial spoke not, but it made shrewd signs,<br />
<span class="pgnm">452</span><a id="page_452" name="page_452"></a>
And pointed full upon the stroke of murder:<br />
Yet this you said,<br />
You were a woman, ignorant and weak,<br />
So left it to my care.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Leo.</span> What, if I said,<br />
I was a woman, ignorant and weak,<br />
Were you to take the advantage of my sex,<br />
And play the devil to tempt me? You contrived,<br />
You urged, you drove me headlong to your toils;<br />
And if, much tired, and frighted more, I paused,<br />
Were you to make my doubts your own commission?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Bert.</span> This 'tis, to serve a prince too faithfully;<br />
Who, free from laws himself, will have that done,<br />
Which, not performed, brings us to sure disgrace;<br />
And, if performed, to ruin.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Leo.</span> This 'tis, to counsel things that are unjust;<br />
First, to debauch a king to break his laws,<br />
Which are his safety, and then seek protection<br />
From him you have endangered; but, just heaven,<br />
When sins are judged, will damn the tempting devil,<br />
More deep than those he tempted.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Bert.</span> If princes not protect their ministers,<br />
What man will dare to serve them?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Leo.</span> None will dare<br />
To serve them ill, when they are left to laws;<br />
But, when a counsellor, to save himself,<br />
Would lay miscarriages upon his prince,<br />
Exposing him to public rage and hate;<br />
O, 'tis an act as infamously base,<br />
As, should a common soldier sculk behind,<br />
And thrust his general in the front of war:<br />
It shews, he only served himself before,<br />
And had no sense of honour, country, king,<br />
But centered on himself, and used his master,<br />
As guardians do their wards, with shews of care,<br />
But with intent to sell the public safety,<br />
And pocket up his prince.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="pgnm">453</span><a id="page_453" name="page_453"></a>
<span class="cnm">Ped.</span> Well said, i'faith;<br />
This speech is e'en too good for an usurper.<span class="sdr">[Aside.</span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Bert.</span> I see for whom I must be sacrificed;<br />
And, had I not been sotted with my zeal,<br />
I might have found it sooner.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Leo.</span> From my sight!<br />
The prince, who bears an insolence like this,<br />
Is such an image of the powers above,<br />
As is the statue of the thundering god,<br />
Whose bolts the boys may play with.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Bert.</span> Unrevenged<br />
I will not fall, nor single.<span class="sdr">[Exit.</span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Leo.</span> Welcome, welcome!
<span class="sdr">[To RAYM. who kisses her hand.</span><br />
I saw you not before: One honest lord<br />
Is hid with ease among a crowd of courtiers.<br />
How can I be too grateful to the father<br />
Of such a son as Torrismond?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Raym.</span> His actions were but duty.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Leo.</span> Yet, my lord,<br />
All have not paid that debt, like noble Torrismond.<br />
You hear, how Bertran brands me with a crime,<br />
Of which, your son can witness, I am free.<br />
I sent to stop the murder, but too late;<br />
For crimes are swift, but penitence is slow:<br />
The bloody Bertran, diligent in ill,<br />
Flew to prevent the soft returns of pity.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Raym.</span> O cursed haste, of making sure of sin!&mdash;<br />
Can you forgive the traitor?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Leo.</span> Never, never:<br />
'Tis written here in characters so deep,<br />
That seven years hence, ('till then should I not meet him,)<br />
And in the temple then, I'll drag him thence,<br />
Even from the holy altar to the block.</p>

To bear affronts, too great to be forgiven,<br />
And not have power to punish; yet one way<br />
There is to ruin Bertran.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Leo.</span> O, there's none;<br />
Except an host from heaven can make such haste<br />
To save my crown, as he will do to seize it.<br />
You saw, he came surrounded with his friends,<br />
And knew, besides, our army was removed<br />
To quarters too remote for sudden use.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Raym.</span> Yet you may give commission<br />
To some bold man, whose loyalty you trust,<br />
And let him raise the train-bands of the city.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Leo.</span> Gross feeders, lion talkers, lamb-like fighters.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Raym.</span> You do not know the virtues of your city,<br />
What pushing force they have; some popular chief,<br />
More noisy than the rest, but cries halloo,<br />
And, in a trice, the bellowing herd come out;<br />
The gates are barred, the ways are barricadoed,<br />
And <i>One and all's</i> the word; true cocks o'the game,<br />
That never ask, for what, or whom, they fight;<br />
But turn them out, and shew them but a foe,<br />
Cry&mdash;<i>Liberty!</i> and that's a cause of quarrel.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Leo.</span> There may be danger in that boisterous rout:<br />
Who knows, when fires are kindled for my foes,<br />
But some new blast of wind may turn those flames<br />

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Raym.</span> But still their chief<br />
Must be some one, whose loyalty you trust.</p>

Fate scarce knew where to find them, when I called?<br />
Have I heaped on my person, crown, and state,<br />

Can I, can any loyal subject, see<br />

An ocean poured upon a narrow brook?<br />
My zeal for you must lay the father by,<br />
And plead my country's cause against my son.<br />
What though his heart be great, his actions gallant,<br />
He wants a crown to poise against a crown,<br />
Birth to match birth, and power to balance power.</p>

Kisses, embraces, languishing, and death,<br />

traitorously conspired the cuckoldom of me, her anointed
sovereign lord; and, with the help of the
aforesaid friar, whom heaven confound, and with
the limbs of one colonel Hernando, cuckold-maker
of this city, devilishly contrived to steal herself
away, and under her arm feloniously to bear one
casket of diamonds, pearls, and other jewels, to the

how sayest thou, culprit?</p>

portal; and his wife, my penitent, making doleful
lamentations: thereupon, making what haste my
limbs would suffer me, that are crippled with often
kneeling, I saw him spurning and listing her most
unmercifully; whereupon, using Christian arguments
with him to desist, he fell violently upon
me, without respect to my sacerdotal orders, pushed
me from him, and turned me about with a finger
<span class="pgnm">480</span><a id="page_480" name="page_480"></a>
and a thumb, just as a man would set up a top.
Mercy! quoth I.&mdash;Damme! quoth he;&mdash;and still

my oath, I had never seen him. Well, this noble
colonel, like a true gentleman, was for taking the
weaker part, you may be sure; whereupon this Gomez
flew upon him like a dragon, got him down,
the devil being strong in him, and gave him bastinado
upon bastinado, and buffet upon buffet, which
the poor meek colonel, being prostrate, suffered
with a most Christian patience.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Gom.</span> Who? he meek? I'm sure I quake at the

he made assault and battery upon my person,

BY A FRIEND OF THE AUTHOR'S.</h3>

<div class="poem">
<p>There's none, I'm sure, who is a friend to love,</p>
<p>But will our Friar's character approve:</p>
<p>The ablest spark among you sometimes needs</p>
<p>Such pious help, for charitable deeds.</p>
<p>Our church, alas! (as Rome objects) does want</p>
<p>These ghostly comforts for the falling saint:</p>
<p>This gains them their whore-converts, and may be</p>
<p>One reason of the growth of popery.</p>
<p>So Mahomet's religion came in fashion,</p>
<p>By the large leave it gave to fornication.</p>
<p>Fear not the guilt, if you can pay for't well;</p>
<p>There is no Dives in the Roman Hell:</p>
<p>Gold opens the strait gate, and lets him in;</p>
<p>But want of money is a mortal sin.</p>
<p>For all besides you may discount to heaven,</p>
<p>And drop a bead to keep the tallies even.</p>
<p>How are men cozened still with shows of good!</p>
<p>The bawd's best mask is the grave friar's hood;</p>
<p>Though vice no more a clergyman displeases,</p>
<p>Than doctors can be thought to hate diseases.</p>
<p>'Tis by your living ill, that they live well,</p>
<p>By your debauches, their fat paunches swell.</p>
<p>'Tis a mock-war between the priest and devil;</p>
<p>When they think fit, they can be very civil.</p>
<p>As some, who did French counsels most advance,</p>
<p>To blind the world, have railed in print at France,</p>
<p>Thus do the clergy at your vices bawl,</p>
<p>That with more ease they may engross them all.</p>
<p>By damning yours, they do their own maintain;</p>
<p>A churchman's godliness is always gain:</p>
<p>Hence to their prince they will superior be;</p>
<p>And civil treason grows church loyalty.</p>
<p>They boast the gift of heaven is in their power;</p>
<p>Well may they give the god, they can devour!</p>
<p><span class="pgnm">486</span><a id="page_486" name="page_486"></a>
Still to the sick and dead their claims they lay;</p>
<p>For 'tis on carrion that the vermin prey.</p>
<p>Nor have they less dominion on our life,</p>
<p>They trot the husband, and they pace the wife.</p>
<p>Rouse up, you cuckolds of the northern climes,</p>
<p>And learn from Sweden to prevent such crimes.</p>
<p>Unman the Friar, and leave the holy drone</p>
<p>To hum in his forsaken hive alone;</p>
<p>He'll work no honey, when his sting is gone.</p>
<p>Your wives and daughters soon will leave the cells,</p>
<p>When they have lost the sound of Aaron's bells.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
